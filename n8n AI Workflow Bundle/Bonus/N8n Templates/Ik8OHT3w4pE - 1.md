# Workflow Analysis for AI-Driven Text Processing and Email Notification System

## Description
This workflow automatically ingests raw text data via an API call, leverages a large language model to perform advanced processing (like summarization, classification, or translation), and then delivers the structured result to a designated recipient via email.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an inbound Webhook, expecting a JSON payload containing the text or data that needs to be processed by the AI model.

## Process Summary
The workflow is initiated by receiving data through a Webhook trigger. A subsequent Function node then formats the incoming text into a structured prompt suitable for the AI model. An OpenAI node is called to execute the specific AI task (e.g., summarization or analysis) based on the prepared prompt. Finally, a Set node cleans and prepares the AI-generated output for structured delivery.

## Output Details
The final, processed output from the AI model is sent as a new message or notification via an Email node (e.g., using an SMTP server or dedicated email service).
