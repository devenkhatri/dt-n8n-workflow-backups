# Workflow Analysis for Analysis Failed: Missing n8n Workflow JSON Content

## Description
The request provided only metadata (file name, path, URL, etc.) for the n8n workflow, but did not include the actual JSON configuration content. I am unable to perform the required analysis without the workflow's code. Please paste the n8n workflow JSON content directly to receive a full analysis.

## Input Details
The input received was file metadata (name, URL, SHA) but not the content of the n8n workflow JSON.

## Process Summary
The analysis process failed at the data ingestion step because the core input—the n8n workflow JSON structure—was not present. Therefore, no steps for node identification, data flow mapping, or logic summarization could be executed.

## Output Details
No analysis was produced as the source workflow data is missing. The output explains the need for the full JSON content.
