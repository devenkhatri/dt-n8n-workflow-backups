# Workflow Analysis for Scheduled AI-Powered Social Media Content Generator

## Description
This workflow automatically runs on a schedule, uses an AI model to generate a batch of engaging social media posts, saves the generated content to a Google Sheet for easy review and scheduling, and notifies a Slack channel when the process is complete.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a Schedule Trigger, set to run periodically (e.g., once a week) without requiring external data.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a schedule trigger and then calls an OpenAI node to generate a batch of content ideas based on a hardcoded prompt. The content is then restructured and cleaned using a Code node to prepare it for database entry. A Google Sheets node appends the final structured posts, including metadata, to a specified spreadsheet. Finally, a Slack node sends a completion notification to a team channel.

## Output Details
The workflow saves the newly generated social media content into a Google Sheet for review and archives, and sends a completion notification to a designated Slack channel.
