# Workflow Analysis for Google Sheets Data Processor with OpenAI Chat Completion

## Description
This workflow manually initiates a process to read existing data from a Google Sheet, uses OpenAI's chat model to generate or modify content for each row, and then updates the corresponding row in the spreadsheet with the AI-generated output.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually by a user click within the n8n interface.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts manually and retrieves all rows of data from a specified Google Sheet. It then uses the Split In Batches node to process each row individually. For every row, it calls the OpenAI Chat Completion API to generate new content based on a structured prompt. An IF node checks if the AI returned a non-empty response. If content is successfully generated, the original Google Sheet row is updated with the new AI-generated text.

## Output Details
The final output is the updated Google Sheet, where selected rows now contain new, AI-generated content in a designated column.
