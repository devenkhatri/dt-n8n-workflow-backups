# Workflow Analysis for Webhook Triggered Document Translation and Google Drive Upload (French)

## Description
This workflow automatically translates a document shared via a webhook URL into French and then saves the translated file to a specified folder in Google Drive.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a webhook that receives an HTTP request, likely containing a URL for the document to be translated.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts when a webhook is received, containing a file URL which is then used to download the file via an HTTP request. The downloaded file is immediately sent to the DeepL service for translation into the French language. After translation, a Set node renames and packages the translated document data. Finally, the translated document is uploaded to a specified folder in Google Drive.

## Output Details
The primary output is a translated file saved to a configured folder within Google Drive.
