# Workflow Analysis for AI Content Generation and API Responder

## Description
This automation receives a text request through a webhook, processes the request using an AI service to generate content (like an article, summary, or response), and then sends the complete AI-generated output back to the caller as an immediate API response.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming HTTP POST request to a defined webhook endpoint, typically receiving a prompt or data payload.

## Process Summary
The workflow is initiated by an incoming Webhook request containing input data. This data is structured and passed to a generative AI node, such as OpenAI, to produce the desired content based on the configured prompt. The AI's generated response is then immediately captured and returned to the system that initiated the webhook call.

## Output Details
The final AI-generated content is sent back to the initiating application as an HTTP response from the webhook.
