# Workflow Analysis for Analysis Failed: Missing n8n Workflow Content

## Description
The analysis could not be performed because the actual n8n workflow JSON content was not provided. The input contained only metadata about a file (name, path, size, and URLs) and not the runnable workflow definition required for analysis. Please provide the full JSON content of the n8n workflow.

## Input Details
N/A - The actual n8n workflow JSON content is missing. Only file metadata was received.

## Process Summary
The analysis process failed at the initial step as the input data did not contain the expected n8n workflow structure. The analyzer requires the complete JSON configuration to identify the nodes, connections, and logic.

## Output Details
No analysis output was generated due to missing input.
