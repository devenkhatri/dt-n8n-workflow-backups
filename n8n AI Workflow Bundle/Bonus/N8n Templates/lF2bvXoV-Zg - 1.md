# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Blog Post Idea Generator (OpenAI to Google Sheets)

## Description
This workflow leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) like OpenAI to generate a list of creative blog post ideas based on a given topic, and then automatically saves those ideas into a specified Google Sheet for content planning and tracking.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered, likely requiring a simple text input defining the subject or topic for which blog ideas should be generated.

## Process Summary
The manual trigger starts the process, taking the specified topic as input. The input topic is sent to the OpenAI node with a specific prompt to generate a list of blog post ideas. These ideas are then typically formatted and split into individual items to be processed separately. Finally, each generated idea is appended as a new row in a connected Google Sheets spreadsheet for storage.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a set of new rows in a Google Sheets document, each containing a unique, AI-generated blog post idea.
