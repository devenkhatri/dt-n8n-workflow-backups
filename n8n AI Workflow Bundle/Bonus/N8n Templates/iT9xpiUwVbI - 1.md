# Workflow Analysis for Simple AI Chatbot Webhook Responder

## Description
This workflow acts as a basic AI assistant. It takes a user's input, sends it to a large language model (like OpenAI's GPT) for processing, and then returns the AI's generated response directly back to the calling system.

## Input Details
The workflow is likely triggered by a Webhook or manually, receiving a user query or input text.

## Process Summary
The workflow receives the user input and prepares the data for the AI. It then sends the input to the OpenAI Chat model, which follows instructions to act as a helpful assistant. After the AI generates a response, a subsequent step extracts the content. Finally, the AI-generated text is returned as the response to the initial trigger.

## Output Details
The AI-generated response text is immediately returned to the system that triggered the workflow via a webhook response.
