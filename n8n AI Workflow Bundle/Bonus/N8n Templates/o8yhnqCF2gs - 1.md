# Workflow Analysis for Workflow from Webhook to PostgreSQL Upsert

## Description
This workflow processes data received via a webhook, transforms it, and then upserts it into a PostgreSQL database, while also handling potential errors and sending notifications.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP webhook that receives JSON data.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by merging incoming data to ensure all necessary fields are present. It then uses a Code node to process the merged data, followed by a Set node to structure specific fields. If an error occurs during this process, a custom notification is sent via a Code node. Finally, the processed data is upserted into a PostgreSQL database.

## Output Details
The workflow upserts data into a PostgreSQL database and sends error notifications via Pushover or an n8n webhook.
