# Workflow Analysis for Webflow CMS Item Management

## Description
This workflow automates the creation, updating, and deletion of CMS items in Webflow based on a specified action.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually and requires user input for the Webflow collection ID, item ID, and the desired action (Create, Update, or Delete).

## Process Summary
The workflow begins by requesting user input for the Webflow collection, item ID, and action. It then uses an IF node to branch based on the selected action. If "Create" is selected, it constructs a JSON object for the new item and creates it in Webflow. If "Update" is selected, it constructs an update JSON and modifies the existing Webflow item. If "Delete" is selected, the specified Webflow item is deleted. Finally, the workflow returns a success message.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a confirmation message indicating whether the Webflow CMS item was successfully created, updated, or deleted.
