# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Text Processing Template Workflow

## Description
This workflow is designed to process and analyze text using an AI model. It typically involves receiving an input text and leveraging a large language model (LLM), such as OpenAI's GPT, to perform tasks like summarization, classification, or content generation, making the resulting processed text available for subsequent actions.

## Input Details
The workflow is initiated by a manual trigger, requiring the user to explicitly start the process and provide the necessary input text data.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins with a manual trigger, allowing for direct testing and execution of the process. A subsequent node prepares the text input, often by defining a variable containing the content to be analyzed. An OpenAI node is then invoked to perform the core AI task, applying a specific prompt to the input text. Finally, a Set node structures and cleans up the AI's response, isolating the desired processed text before the workflow concludes.

## Output Details
The final output is a structured data object containing the processed result from the AI model, such as a cleaned summary or analyzed text.
