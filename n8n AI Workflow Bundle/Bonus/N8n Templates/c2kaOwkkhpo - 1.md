# Workflow Analysis for Automated AI Content Generation, Logging, and Email Distribution

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the generation of content using a large language model based on an incoming external request, securely logging the interaction details, and distributing the final result via email.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP Webhook, receiving an external JSON payload that contains the necessary input data and prompt for the content generation process.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins with a Webhook Trigger capturing the input request. A subsequent Set node extracts and transforms the raw data into a clean, contextual prompt. This prompt is then sent to an OpenAI node, which processes the request and generates the final content. Following content generation, a Google Sheets node is used to log the input prompt and the generated output for tracking purposes. Finally, the complete generated content is delivered via an SMTP Send Email node.

## Output Details
The generated text content is logged to a Google Sheet for auditing and is simultaneously sent as a professional email notification to a specified recipient.
