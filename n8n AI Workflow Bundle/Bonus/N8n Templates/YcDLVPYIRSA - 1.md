# Workflow Analysis for Google Drive Document to Pinecone Embedding Pipeline

## Description
This workflow processes a document by first retrieving it from Google Drive, extracting its text content using Google Docs, generating a vector embedding of the text using OpenAI, and finally storing the embedding along with the file metadata in a Pinecone vector database for future retrieval or RAG operations.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered, expecting 'folderId', 'fileId', and 'fileName' as input data to identify the document to process.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a manual trigger that specifies the file to process. It uses the Google Drive node to retrieve the file and the Google Docs node to extract the file's text content. The extracted text is then passed to the OpenAI node to generate a vector embedding using the 'text-embedding-ada-002' model. Finally, the resulting embedding vector, identified by the file's ID and including its filename as metadata, is upserted into the "google-drive-embeddings" collection in Pinecone.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a vector embedding and associated metadata into the "google-drive-embeddings" collection in a Pinecone vector database.
