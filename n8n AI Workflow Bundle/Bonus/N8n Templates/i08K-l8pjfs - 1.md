# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Content Generation and Notification Workflow

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the content creation process by taking an external prompt, feeding it to an AI model for generation, and then distributing the final output to a database and an alert system. It is ideal for automatically producing articles, summaries, or reports based on external triggers.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an external HTTP POST request to a dedicated webhook, which provides the prompt or query needed for content generation.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a webhook trigger that captures the input query for content generation. This query is passed to the OpenAI Chat node, which utilizes a large language model to generate the requested article or text. A Set node then extracts and formats the AI-generated text into a clean variable for downstream use. Subsequently, the workflow branches to simultaneously save the generated article to a specified Google Sheet. Concurrently, an email notification is sent to an administrator, summarizing the generated content and its completion.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a newly generated text article, which is stored in a Google Sheet and delivered as part of an email notification.
