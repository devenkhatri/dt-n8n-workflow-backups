# Workflow Analysis for AI Text Processing and Output Automation

## Description
An automated workflow designed to accept input via a webhook, utilize an AI model (like OpenAI) to perform a text transformation or generation task, and then send the resulting content to an output destination.

## Input Details
The workflow is activated by an external HTTP request hitting a dedicated Webhook trigger, which provides the raw text or data required for AI processing.

## Process Summary
The workflow initiates with a Webhook to capture incoming data. The data is then pre-processed and formatted using a Set node to prepare the prompt. The core operation involves an AI model (e.g., OpenAI) using the prepared prompt to generate or modify the text. Finally, the processed content is prepared for delivery using another Set node before being sent to its final destination.

## Output Details
The resulting, AI-generated content is delivered to a connected service, such as a messenger application or a database, or returned as an API response.
