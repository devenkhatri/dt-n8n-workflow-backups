# Workflow Analysis for AI Text Summarizer via Webhook

## Description
This workflow is designed to instantly summarize text using the OpenAI language model. It accepts text, a target language, and a desired tone via a webhook. The AI processes the request, generates a summary adhering to the specified parameters, and immediately returns the result to the caller.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming HTTP POST request to a webhook endpoint, receiving JSON data containing the text to be summarized, the target language, and the desired tone.

## Process Summary
The workflow is initiated by a Webhook trigger, receiving the source text and summarization parameters. A subsequent Set node structures the input data for the AI model. The core step involves the OpenAI node, which uses a chat completion model to generate the summary based on the specified text, tone, and language. A final Set node extracts and prepares the AI's response text. The process concludes by sending the complete, structured summary back to the client via a Respond to Webhook node.

## Output Details
The workflow returns the AI-generated text summary in JSON format directly back to the client that initiated the webhook call.
