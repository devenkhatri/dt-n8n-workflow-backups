# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Automated Code Review for GitHub Pull Requests

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the code review process by using artificial intelligence. It automatically triggers when a Pull Request is created or updated in a GitHub repository, fetches all relevant details, sends the information to a large language model (like GPT-4) for analysis, and posts the AI-generated summary and suggestions as a comment directly on the Pull Request.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by the GitHub Trigger node upon specific Pull Request events (opened, reopened, or closed) in a connected repository.

## Process Summary
The workflow initiates upon a GitHub PR event, then extracts the PR URL to fetch comprehensive details, including the title, body, and list of files changed. This data is structured and sent to an OpenAI node, where a system prompt instructs the AI to act as an expert code reviewer and generate a detailed analysis. Finally, the AI-generated review content is posted back to the original Pull Request as a new comment using a GitHub node.

## Output Details
The workflow posts a formatted comment containing the AI's detailed review summary, critique, and suggestions back to the relevant Pull Request on GitHub.
