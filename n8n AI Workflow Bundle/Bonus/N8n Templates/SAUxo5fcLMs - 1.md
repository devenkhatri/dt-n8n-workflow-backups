# Workflow Analysis for API Data Analysis and Reporting via AI to Google Sheets

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the process of fetching external data, using an Artificial Intelligence model (like OpenAI/ChatGPT) to analyze or transform the data, and then logging the structured results into a Google Sheet for reporting or storage.

## Input Details
The workflow is initiated manually and its primary input is the data retrieved from an external source via an HTTP Request.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins with a manual trigger, followed by an HTTP Request to fetch a list of records from an external API. It then splits the retrieved records into smaller batches for optimized processing. Next, an AI node is used to perform content analysis, summarization, or generation based on each record's data. Finally, a Set node structures the output fields before appending the complete, analyzed data to a Google Sheet.

## Output Details
The final structured and AI-analyzed data is written as new rows into a specified Google Sheet.
