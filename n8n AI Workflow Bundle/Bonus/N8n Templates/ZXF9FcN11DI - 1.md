# Workflow Analysis for AI Content Summarizer and Logger to Google Sheets

## Description
This workflow automatically fetches content from a specified URL, uses an AI model (OpenAI) to generate a summary focusing on a particular topic, and then records the source URL, topic, and the resulting summary into a designated Google Sheet.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually (by the 'Start' node followed by a 'Code' node which defines a test URL and topic) or can be adapted for a webhook trigger to process external data.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by defining the content URL and target topic, then uses an HTTP request to fetch the content from the URL. The HTML is cleaned using Cheerio to extract the main text. Next, an OpenAI Chat node is utilized to summarize the extracted content based on the provided topic. Finally, a Code node organizes the output data, and the structured result (URL, Topic, Summary) is appended as a new row to a Google Sheet.

## Output Details
The resulting URL, the requested topic, and the AI-generated summary are appended as a new row to a specific Google Sheet spreadsheet.
