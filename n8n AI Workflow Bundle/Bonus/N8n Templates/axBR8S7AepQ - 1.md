# Workflow Analysis for AI Content Generation via Webhook API

## Description
This workflow is triggered by an external system to initiate a process for content generation or data analysis using an external AI model, after which it delivers the results back to the caller.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a Webhook, which expects an external HTTP request containing the necessary input prompt or data for the AI processing task.

## Process Summary
The workflow is activated upon receiving an external HTTP request via the Webhook trigger. It likely uses a Set node to extract and format the input data into a clean prompt. This formatted prompt is then sent to an OpenAI node to leverage a large language model for content creation or analysis. A final Function node may be used to parse or clean up the AI's response before it is returned.

## Output Details
The generated or analyzed content from the AI model is sent back as a structured response to the initiating Webhook request.
