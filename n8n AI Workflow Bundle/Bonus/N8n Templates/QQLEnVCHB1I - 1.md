# Workflow Analysis for AI Document Change Summarizer for Google Drive

## Description
This workflow automatically detects when a document is edited in Google Drive, downloads the file content, uses an Artificial Intelligence model (OpenAI) to generate a summary of the content, and then sends that summary via email.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a Webhook configured to receive POST requests, likely from a Google Drive change notification system, expecting a payload with details including a file ID and a "document_edited" trigger.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a Webhook trigger and immediately checks if the event is a "document_edited" trigger, stopping if the condition is false. If true, it downloads the specified file from Google Drive and reads its content as plain text. This text is then passed to OpenAI, which is instructed to act as an expert summarizer. Finally, the generated summary is sent out as a new email notification.

## Output Details
The workflow produces an email notification containing the AI-generated summary of the edited Google Drive document, sent to a configured recipient.
