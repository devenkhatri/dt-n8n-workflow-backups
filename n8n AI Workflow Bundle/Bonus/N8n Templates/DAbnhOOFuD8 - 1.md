# Workflow Analysis for Webhook-Triggered Text Summarization and Google Sheets Logging

## Description
This workflow automatically accepts a block of text via a webhook, uses an Artificial Intelligence model (like GPT) to generate a concise summary of the content in bullet points, and then logs the date, original text length, and the generated summary into a specified Google Sheet.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an external POST webhook receiving JSON data containing a long text field and a target Google Sheet ID.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving the data via a webhook. It then sends the received long_text content to an AI model with instructions to summarize it in three bullet points. The resulting summary text is captured and formatted using a Set node for clarity. Finally, a new row is appended to the specified Google Sheet, logging the current date, the length of the original text, and the AI-generated summary.

## Output Details
A new row containing the summary, original text length, and date is appended to a specified Google Sheet.
