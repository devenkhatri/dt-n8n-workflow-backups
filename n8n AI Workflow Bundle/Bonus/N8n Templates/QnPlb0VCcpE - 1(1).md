# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Webhook Data Processing and Google Sheets Logging

## Description
This workflow is triggered by an incoming webhook, where it captures raw data and sends it to an Artificial Intelligence model for advanced analysis, summarization, or structured extraction. The processed data is then logged into a specified Google Sheets spreadsheet, providing an automated data pipeline from an external source to a centralized report.

## Input Details
The workflow is initiated by an external system sending a payload to a Webhook URL, which captures the raw input data.

## Process Summary
Upon receiving data via a Webhook, the workflow uses a Set node to prepare the data structure. It then passes the prepared data to an OpenAI Chat node, which uses a system prompt to perform the necessary analysis or transformation. The resulting AI output is checked for validity using an IF node. If the output is valid, the extracted information is appended to a row in Google Sheets; otherwise, an error or fallback message is handled.

## Output Details
The processed, AI-enriched data is written as a new row in a Google Sheets spreadsheet, and a final status or the processed data is returned as a response to the initiating Webhook.
