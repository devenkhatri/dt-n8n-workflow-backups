# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Content Generation and Data Logging to Google Sheets

## Description
This workflow accepts text input, uses an AI model (like OpenAI) to perform a specific task (e.g., summarization, text generation, or categorization), and then records the original input and the generated AI output into a Google Sheet for logging and record-keeping.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered, allowing the user to provide initial input data, such as a text prompt or content piece, to begin the process.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a manual trigger, followed by setting up the prompt and configuration for the AI service. It then calls an AI model (e.g., OpenAI) to execute a text generation or analysis task based on the provided configuration. A subsequent node processes and extracts the clean text output from the AI response. Finally, the original input data and the processed AI result are appended as a new row in a specified Google Sheet.

## Output Details
The final output is the successful logging of the original prompt and the newly generated AI content into a row in a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
