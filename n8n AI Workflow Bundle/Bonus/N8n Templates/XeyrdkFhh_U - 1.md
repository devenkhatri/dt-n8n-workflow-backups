# Workflow Analysis for AI Text Processing and Email Notification Workflow

## Description
This workflow is designed to process incoming text data via a webhook, utilize a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI to perform a text operation such as summarization or analysis, and then dispatch the resulting output via email to a designated recipient. It serves as an automated text analysis and notification system.

## Input Details
The workflow is initiated by an incoming HTTP POST request to a webhook, receiving a data payload that contains the text or information to be processed.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins by listening for an incoming data payload via a webhook trigger. It then uses a subsequent node to structure and prepare the input data into a clean prompt for the AI model. Next, it calls an AI service (like OpenAI) to perform the desired text operation, such as summarization or categorization. Finally, it uses an email service node to send a notification containing both the original input and the AI-generated result to a defined recipient.

## Output Details
The workflow's final output is a structured email sent to a configured address, containing the processed AI summary/analysis alongside the initial request details.
