# Workflow Analysis for Analysis Failed: Raw Workflow JSON Missing

## Description
Unable to perform the n8n workflow analysis. The input provided was a URL to the workflow JSON on an external platform (GitHub), but the raw JSON content was not included directly in the request. For security and environment constraints, external links cannot be accessed to retrieve the data needed for analysis. Please copy and paste the raw JSON content of the workflow into your next request.

## Input Details
The raw n8n workflow JSON content is missing.

## Process Summary
The analysis process failed at the initial step because the provided input was a URL pointing to an external resource, and not the required raw n8n workflow JSON data. External data fetching is restricted, preventing the workflow structure from being loaded and analyzed.

## Output Details
Analysis failure due to inaccessible source data.
