# Workflow Analysis for Analysis Failed: Missing n8n Workflow JSON

## Description
I am unable to analyze the n8n workflow because the actual JSON content, which defines the nodes, connections, and logic, was not provided in the request. Only the file metadata (name, path, URLs) was supplied. Please provide the complete n8n workflow JSON for processing.

## Input Details
The n8n workflow JSON content is required as input for analysis.

## Process Summary
The analysis process requires parsing the workflow's node structure to identify the trigger, logic steps, and outputs. This step could not be completed due to missing data.

## Output Details
A structured analysis cannot be generated. Please provide the complete n8n workflow JSON for processing.
