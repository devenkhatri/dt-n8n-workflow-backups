# Workflow Analysis for Webhook-Triggered AI Text Summarization Service

## Description
This workflow is designed to receive a block of text via an external system, leverage the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate a structured summary of that text, and immediately return the summary as an API response. It serves as a rapid AI-powered summarization service.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an external POST request to a specific webhook endpoint, expecting the request body to contain the text that needs to be summarized.

## Process Summary
The workflow initiates upon receiving an HTTP POST request via the Webhook Trigger node. The received input text is then passed to the OpenAI node, which utilizes the GPT-4 model to generate a concise summary formatted into five bullet points. This generated summary is captured from the AI model's response. Finally, the workflow constructs a JSON response containing the summary and sends it back to the client via the Respond to Webhook node.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a JSON response containing the AI-generated text summary, which is returned directly via the webhook to the system that initiated the workflow.
