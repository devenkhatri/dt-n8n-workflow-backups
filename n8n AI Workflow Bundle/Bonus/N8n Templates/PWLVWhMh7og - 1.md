# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered URL Content Extractor and Summarizer

## Description
This workflow is designed to function as an on-demand API endpoint. It accepts a URL via a POST request, fetches the webpage content, cleans the HTML to extract only the plain text, and then leverages the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate a structured, three-paragraph summary of the text, which is immediately returned to the caller.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an external HTTP POST request to a defined webhook path (`summarize-url`) and expects to receive the URL of the webpage to be processed in the request body.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts when an external service sends a POST request to the webhook, providing a URL to be summarized. It uses an HTTP Request node to fetch the HTML content of that URL, followed by an HTML Operations node to clean and strip the content down to plain text. The cleaned text is prepared and then sent to an OpenAI (GPT-4) node which is configured with a system prompt to act as an expert summarizer. The resulting summary is then used to fulfill the webhook request.

## Output Details
The final output is the structured, three-paragraph summary generated by OpenAI, which is sent back as a JSON response to the initial webhook caller.
