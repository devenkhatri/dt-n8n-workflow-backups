# Workflow Analysis for AI Text Summarizer and API Responder

## Description
This workflow is designed to receive raw text via an API call, leverage an Artificial Intelligence model to generate a concise summary of that text, and immediately return the generated summary as the final API response.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming HTTP POST request to a dedicated webhook URL, expecting a JSON payload that contains the text data needing summarization.

## Process Summary
The workflow initiates upon receiving a POST request via the Webhook Trigger. The incoming text payload is then routed to the OpenAI node, which uses a pre-defined prompt to instruct the AI model to summarize the input. After the AI model generates the summary, the result is extracted from the model's response. Finally, this extracted summary is sent back to the requesting client using the Respond to Webhook node, completing the synchronous API interaction.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a JSON response containing the AI-generated text summary, which is returned directly to the client that initiated the webhook call.
