# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Content Generator for Google Sheets

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the generation of content using a large language model and subsequently save the structured output into a Google Sheet. It's ideal for creating bulk content like marketing ideas, social media posts, or article outlines that need to be centralized for review or deployment.

## Input Details
The workflow is initiated by a manual trigger, allowing a user to run the process ad-hoc.

## Process Summary
The workflow is started manually, followed by a Code node that defines the system prompt and user input variables for the AI model. The OpenAI Chat node then uses these inputs to generate structured content. A Split In Batches node processes the AI response, breaking down the generated output into individual items. Finally, a Set node formats the resulting data fields before the data is appended to Google Sheets.

## Output Details
The processed and formatted AI-generated data is appended as new rows into a specified Google Sheets spreadsheet.
