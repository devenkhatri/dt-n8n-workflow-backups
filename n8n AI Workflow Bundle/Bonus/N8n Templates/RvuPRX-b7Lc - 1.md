# Workflow Analysis for AI Article Generator from Title and Tone

## Description
This workflow uses an AI language model (likely OpenAI's Chat API) to generate a complete article based on a user-defined title and writing tone, automating the initial content creation process.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and requires initial variables to be set within a node, defining the article's title and the desired writing tone.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by manually setting the article title and writing tone variables. It then calls the OpenAI Chat API, prompting the model to generate a full article draft using the provided inputs. The generated text is subsequently processed and formatted for cleanliness. Finally, the complete article is saved as a file to a specified file storage location.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a complete text file containing the generated article, which is then saved to a specified file storage location.
