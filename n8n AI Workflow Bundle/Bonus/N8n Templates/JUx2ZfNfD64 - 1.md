# Workflow Analysis for Extract Text from Image (OCR) and Notify Discord

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the process of extracting text from images and instantly sharing the results. It listens for an image URL via a webhook, uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read the text in the image, and sends the resulting text to a Discord channel for notification and review.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming HTTP POST request to a webhook, which must contain the URL of the image to be processed by the OCR engine.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a webhook trigger that receives an image URL from an external source. Next, the Tesseract.js node performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the provided image URL to extract all readable text. A subsequent Code node formats and prepares the extracted text into a structured message payload. Finally, the prepared message containing the image's text is sent to a specific Discord channel via the Discord node.

## Output Details
The workflow's final output is a text message containing the extracted OCR data, which is posted to a specified Discord channel as a notification.
