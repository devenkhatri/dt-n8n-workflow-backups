# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Content Processing and Routing

## Description
This workflow automates the process of receiving external data, analyzing it using an AI model for summarization or classification, and then routing the information to the appropriate system (a database for approved items or a communication channel for items needing review).

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming HTTP POST request to a Webhook URL, receiving a payload containing the data to be processed.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a webhook receiving raw data, which is then processed by a Function node to extract and format key variables. Next, an OpenAI node calls a chat model to perform an AI operation, such as summarization or classification, on the input text. An If node conditionally splits the workflow path based on the AI's result. Approved or classified data is saved to a database, while items requiring human attention trigger a notification via a messaging service.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs processed and classified data to an external database (e.g., Airtable) and sends conditional notifications via a communication service (e.g., Slack), finally responding to the triggering webhook with a confirmation.
