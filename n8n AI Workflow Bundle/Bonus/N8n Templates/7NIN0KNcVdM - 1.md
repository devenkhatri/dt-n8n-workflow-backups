# Workflow Analysis for Webhook Data Logger to Google Sheets

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the process of receiving text input, classifying its content using an AI model, and logging the results while providing an immediate response. It's useful for sorting incoming messages, requests, or feedback into predefined categories for better organizational management and subsequent actions.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an external system sending data (likely text) to a Webhook URL.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a payload via a Webhook trigger. A Google Sheets node is then used to append a new row, logging the incoming request data and any necessary context. Following the logging, a Respond to Webhook node sends a custom response back to the service that initiated the workflow, confirming receipt and completion of the process.

## Output Details
The workflow logs the processed data and the AI classification into a Google Sheet and returns a customized response to the calling Webhook.
