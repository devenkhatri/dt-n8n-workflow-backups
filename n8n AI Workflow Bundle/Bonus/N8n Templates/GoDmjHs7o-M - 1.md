# Workflow Analysis for Webhook-Triggered AI Document Summarization and Notification

## Description
This workflow is designed to automatically receive text documents or data via a webhook, pass the content to an AI model for summarization, and then post the resulting summary to a chat application like Slack or Telegram for quick dissemination.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a Webhook, which receives the source text or URL of the document to be summarized in its payload.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins with a Webhook trigger, capturing the incoming data payload. A Function or Set node prepares the text data into a clean, optimized prompt for the AI model. An OpenAI (or similar) node is called with the prompt to generate a concise summary of the text. Finally, a service node (e.g., Slack, Telegram) publishes the generated summary to a designated channel.

## Output Details
The workflow's ultimate output is the AI-generated summary, which is sent as a message to a specific channel in a third-party chat application.
