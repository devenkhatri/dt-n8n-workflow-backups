# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Webhook Data Processor and Activity Logger

## Description
This workflow automatically processes incoming data via a webhook, utilizes an Artificial Intelligence model (like OpenAI) to perform advanced operations (e.g., analysis, summarization, or classification) on the data, and then logs both the input and the generated AI result into a designated tracking system (like Google Sheets) before returning the processed information.

## Input Details
The workflow is initiated by receiving data through a Webhook, which typically involves an external system sending a POST request with a JSON payload.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a payload via a webhook, which is then passed to a transformation node to standardize the input data. The prepared data is sent to an AI service (e.g., OpenAI) to generate a structured response or perform analysis based on a pre-defined prompt. After receiving the AI's output, the raw input and the generated result are logged into an external service like Google Sheets for record keeping. Finally, the processed data is prepared and sent back to the calling system.

## Output Details
The final output is a structured JSON response returned to the initial caller through the Webhook response, containing the results generated by the AI model.
