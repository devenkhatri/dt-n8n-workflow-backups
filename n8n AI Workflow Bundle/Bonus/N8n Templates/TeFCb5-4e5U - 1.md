# Workflow Analysis for Etsy Shop Analytics Report Generation using AI

## Description
This workflow automatically retrieves essential data from an Etsy shop, including shop details, listing information, and monthly statistics. It then sends this combined data to an AI model (like ChatGPT/OpenAI) with a prompt instructing it to act as an expert data analyst. The AI generates a comprehensive monthly performance report, which is then extracted and automatically emailed to the shop owner or relevant stakeholder.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered, allowing a user to initiate the report generation process on demand.

## Process Summary
The workflow is manually triggered and begins by fetching the Etsy shop details. It simultaneously retrieves shop listing data and aggregated monthly shop statistics. This collected data is sent via an HTTP Request to an OpenAI endpoint (ChatGPT) with a custom prompt to generate a detailed performance report. Finally, the workflow extracts the report content from the AI's response and sends it out as an email.

## Output Details
The final output is a comprehensive, AI-generated Etsy monthly performance report delivered to a specified email address.
