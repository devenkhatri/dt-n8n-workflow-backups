# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Content Classification and Workflow Routing

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the process of receiving text submissions, performing AI-driven analysis on the content for classification and summarization, and routing the results to appropriate systems, either for record-keeping in a database or for immediate team notification.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming webhook request, which is expected to contain a JSON payload with the text data to be analyzed.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a Webhook trigger that receives the input data containing the text. The received text is then sent to an LLM node (e.g., OpenAI) for analysis, classification, and summarization based on predefined prompts. An IF node evaluates the AI's classification tag to determine the next step, branching the execution path based on the result. For high-priority or categorized classifications, the processed data is written to an external database like Airtable or Google Sheets for persistent record-keeping. For other categories, a real-time notification containing the summary is sent to a team via Slack or Email for immediate review.

## Output Details
The workflow updates a record in an external database (e.g., Airtable or Google Sheets) and/or sends a notification to a messaging platform (e.g., Slack), while also returning a success API response to the original caller.
