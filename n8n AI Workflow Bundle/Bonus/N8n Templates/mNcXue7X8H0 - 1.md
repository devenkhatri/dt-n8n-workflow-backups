# Workflow Analysis for Weekly Automated AI Content Generation and Publishing Pipeline

## Description
A complete automation workflow that runs on a recurring basis to generate high-quality content, including text and images, using an AI model. The content is then automatically published to a third-party platform, ensuring a continuous and hands-off publishing pipeline.

## Input Details
The workflow is initiated on a weekly schedule (Cron trigger) and reads content prompts or seed data from an external source like a spreadsheet or database.

## Process Summary
The workflow first retrieves a list of generation prompts and iterates through them. For each item, it calls an LLM (e.g., OpenAI) to generate detailed content and a separate call to an image model (e.g., DALL-E) for a featured image. After generation, the data is cleaned and formatted. Finally, the complete content is published to a target CMS/platform (e.g., WordPress or Webflow).

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a published piece of content (blog post, article) on a target platform and sends a confirmation notification via a service like Slack or Email.
