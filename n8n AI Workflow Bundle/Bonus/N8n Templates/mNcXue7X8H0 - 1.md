## Description
This workflow automates the creation of WordPress posts by taking a title, generating content and images using AI, and then publishing the complete post.

## Input Details

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a title and optionally a featured image URL. It then queries the OpenAI API to generate an article based on the provided title. If a featured image URL is not provided, it generates an image using the title and OpenAI. Next, it uploads the generated or provided image to WordPress and extracts necessary image details. Finally, it creates a new WordPress post using the generated content, a default author, the featured image, and assigns the post to a specified category.

## Output Details
