# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Text Summarization via Webhook and Google Sheets Logging

## Description
This workflow is designed to receive text data via an external API call (webhook), process it using an AI model (like OpenAI) to generate a concise summary, log the original request details to a Google Sheet for tracking, and finally return the summary back to the calling service.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an external HTTP POST request via a Webhook, which is expected to contain the text data to be processed.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a payload via a webhook. It then uses a Function node to clean and parse the incoming JSON data. Next, it logs the initial request details into a Google Sheet for audit and tracking purposes. Following the logging, it sends the cleaned text to an OpenAI node to generate a comprehensive summary. Finally, a Set node formats the AI's summary into a structured response before the workflow completes.

## Output Details
The processed data (the AI-generated summary) is returned as an immediate HTTP response to the service that initiated the webhook call.
