# Workflow Analysis for GPS Location Data Ingestion and Geocoding

## Description
This workflow processes incoming GPS coordinate data from a tracking device, converting the coordinates into a readable physical address using a geocoding service, and systematically logs the complete location information to a database or spreadsheet for historical tracking and analysis.

## Input Details
The workflow is initiated via a Webhook trigger that listens for HTTP requests containing device ID, latitude, and longitude details from a tracking source.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins by receiving a location payload through a Webhook trigger. It then uses a node to clean and prepare the latitude and longitude fields for processing. An HTTP Request node (or specialized Geocoding node) is used to perform reverse geocoding, translating the coordinates into a human-readable address. Finally, all the compiled data, including device information, coordinates, and the retrieved address, is inserted into a database for permanent logging.

## Output Details
The final result is a new row inserted into a database or spreadsheet containing the device ID, raw coordinates, and the complete geocoded address.
