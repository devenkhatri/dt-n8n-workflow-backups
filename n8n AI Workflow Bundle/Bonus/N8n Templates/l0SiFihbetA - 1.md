# Workflow Analysis for Webhook Triggered AI Content Generator and Logger

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the generation of content using a large language model (LLM), typically OpenAI. It takes an external request, processes the input using AI, and then logs the interaction to a Google Sheet before returning the generated content. It serves as a reliable backend process for applications requiring on-demand AI-powered text generation.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a Webhook, which expects an external HTTP request containing the necessary input data or prompt for the AI model.

## Process Summary
The process initiates with an incoming Webhook request carrying the prompt. A Set node then formats the payload, preparing the input for the subsequent AI operation. An OpenAI node receives the processed prompt and generates the requested text content. Finally, the generated content and potentially the original input are logged to a Google Sheet for tracking, and the AI response is returned via the Respond to Webhook node.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a written response generated by the AI model, which is immediately returned as the response to the initial Webhook call.
