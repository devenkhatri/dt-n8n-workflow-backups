# Workflow Analysis for AI Document Analysis and Data Extraction to Google Sheets

## Description
This workflow is designed to process an uploaded document (likely a PDF or image), use an AI model (like GPT-4 Vision or similar) to analyze its content, extract structured data based on a defined prompt, and automatically log the extracted information into a Google Sheet for reporting or storage.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually or via a webhook, receiving a file (e.g., PDF or image) and a corresponding request/prompt as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving the document file. It then uses a node to read and potentially encode the document content (e.g., PDF to text/base64). An AI node (e.g., OpenAI) processes the document content along with a system prompt to perform data extraction or summarization. A subsequent node cleans and formats the AI-generated structured data, often using a JSON or Set node. Finally, the clean, structured data is appended as a new row in a designated Google Sheets spreadsheet.

## Output Details
The workflow successfully appends structured data, extracted from the analyzed document, as a new row in a specified Google Sheets spreadsheet.
