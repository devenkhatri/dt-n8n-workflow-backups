# Workflow Analysis for N8N Concepts: Email Personalization & Media Query Automation

## Description
This workflow demonstrates core n8n concepts by automating two distinct processes: personalizing outbound emails using prospect data and AI, and automatically responding to incoming media queries after AI-driven relevance filtering.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered either manually to process data from a Google Sheet, or automatically every hour by new Gmail emails with a specific subject line "SOS Media Queries for 11/25/24 - AM".

## Process Summary
For outbound emails, it fetches prospect LinkedIn data from a Google Sheet. An AI model then personalizes email components (subject, icebreaker, pitch, call to action, PS) based on this data and pre-defined templates. The personalized content is saved back to the Google Sheet, and a draft email is created in Gmail. For inbound media queries, it extracts query details from specific Gmail emails. An AI model evaluates the relevance of each query to the business and drafts a suitable email response if it's relevant. Relevant queries trigger a draft reply email in Gmail, and the original email is labeled for tracking.

## Output Details
The workflow updates a Google Sheet with personalized email content, creates draft personalized emails in Gmail, sends draft AI-generated email replies to relevant media inquiries, and labels processed Gmail messages.
