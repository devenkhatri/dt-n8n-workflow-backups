# Workflow Analysis for AI Content Generation and Google Sheets Logging via Webhook

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the processing of data received via a webhook. It leverages a Code node for data manipulation, an OpenAI node to perform an AI-powered text transformation (such as summarization or content generation), and finally stores the resulting data in a Google Sheet for permanent record keeping.

## Input Details
The workflow is initiated by a Webhook trigger, which receives an external HTTP POST request carrying the data that needs to be processed.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a webhook trigger, followed by a Code node to perform initial data manipulation and prepare the input for the AI model. An OpenAI node then receives the processed data to generate a summarized or transformed text output based on a specific prompt. This output is further processed by another Code node for final structure, before a Google Sheets node records the combined data into a specified spreadsheet.

## Output Details
The processed data, including the original input and the AI-generated content, is outputted to a Google Sheet, creating a new record for tracking and reporting.
