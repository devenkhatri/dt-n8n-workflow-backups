# Workflow Analysis for AI Image Generator and Cloud Storage Uploader via Webhook

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the process of generating images using an AI model (like DALL-E) based on an input prompt received via a webhook. It then uploads the generated image file to a specified cloud storage service and returns a public link to the created asset.

## Input Details
The workflow is initiated by an incoming HTTP request to a webhook, which typically includes a JSON payload containing the text prompt for the desired image.

## Process Summary
The process begins with an incoming webhook receiving the image generation prompt. A subsequent node prepares the input for the AI image generation service. The AI model creates the image based on the prompt, and the resulting image file is passed to a cloud storage node (e.g., Google Drive or S3). This node handles the file upload to the designated storage location. Finally, a response node sends the public link of the uploaded image back to the system that triggered the webhook.

## Output Details
The workflow produces an HTTP response containing the publicly accessible URL of the newly generated and uploaded image file.
