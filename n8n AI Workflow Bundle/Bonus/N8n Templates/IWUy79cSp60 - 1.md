# Workflow Analysis for AI Content Generator and Google Sheets Logger via Webhook

## Description
This workflow listens for an incoming HTTP request containing text, forwards that text to a sophisticated AI model (like GPT-4) with specific instructions, and then logs both the original request and the AI-generated response into a Google Sheet before returning the AI result to the requester.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an external HTTP request (Webhook) which receives input text data in its body.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a webhook trigger, captures the incoming text, and uses a Set node to prepare the prompt for the AI model. It sends the prompt to the OpenAI node for chat completion based on pre-defined system instructions. The resulting AI-generated content is extracted and, if not empty, is conditionally appended as a new row in a designated Google Sheet. Finally, the AI-generated content is sent back as the direct response to the initial webhook call.

## Output Details
The primary output is the AI-generated content, which is returned as a response to the initiating webhook and simultaneously logged into a Google Sheet.
