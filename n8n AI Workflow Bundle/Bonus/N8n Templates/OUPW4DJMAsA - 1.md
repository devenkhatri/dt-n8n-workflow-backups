# Workflow Analysis for CSV/Spreadsheet to Google Sheets Uploader via Webhook

## Description
This workflow is designed to automate the process of taking a spreadsheet or CSV file uploaded via an API call, parsing its content, and appending the resulting structured data as new rows into a designated Google Sheet. It is ideal for automatically logging data from external systems that can submit files.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a Webhook, which expects a data payload containing the file content (e.g., CSV or spreadsheet) in its body.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a Webhook trigger that receives the input file data. The data is immediately split into batches of one item, allowing for processing each item individually. A Spreadsheet File node then reads and parses the incoming file content, converting the rows and columns into structured JSON objects. A subsequent Function node is used to perform any final data preparation or transformation. Finally, the processed data is appended as new rows to a specific Google Sheet, and the workflow confirms completion by responding to the original Webhook call.

## Output Details
The workflow appends the parsed and processed data from the input spreadsheet as new rows into a designated Google Sheets document and returns a confirmation response via the Webhook.
