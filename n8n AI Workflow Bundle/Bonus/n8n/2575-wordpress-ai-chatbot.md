# Workflow Analysis for WordPress AI Chatbot Integration

## Description
This workflow integrates an AI-powered chatbot with a WordPress website to answer user questions using content directly from the WordPress site or by generating an answer with a large language model if the answer is not found in the WordPress content.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP POST request containing a question and a chat history.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow checks if the question can be answered by searching the WordPress site. If relevant content is found, it uses a large language model to generate an answer based on that content. If no relevant content is found on WordPress, it then instructs the large language model to generate an answer based on its general knowledge. Finally, the generated answer is sent back as an HTTP response.

## Output Details
The workflow responds with a JSON object containing the AI-generated answer.
