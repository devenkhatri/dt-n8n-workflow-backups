# Workflow Analysis for Notion to Pinecone Embeddings

## Description
This workflow automates the process of extracting data from a Notion database, generating embeddings for the text content using OpenAI, and then storing these embeddings in a Pinecone vector database. This allows for semantic search and retrieval of Notion content.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered to begin execution.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by retrieving all items from a specified Notion database. It then iterates through each item, extracting relevant text content from various properties. For each extracted text, it leverages OpenAI to generate a numerical embedding. Finally, the generated embeddings along with the Notion item metadata are upserted into a Pinecone index.

## Output Details
The workflow populates a Pinecone vector database with embeddings and metadata derived from Notion database items.
