# Workflow Analysis for ElevenLabs Voice RAG Chatbot

## Description
This workflow creates a voice-enabled chatbot using ElevenLabs for text-to-speech and speech-to-text, integrating with a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system to provide informed responses.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually and receives input from user interactions through a chatbot interface, specifically text queries and audio inputs.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a user's text query. It then converts the text query to speech using ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech. Subsequently, it records the audio input and converts the user's speech back into text using ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text. The transcribed text is then used to query a RAG system, which retrieves relevant information and generates a response. Finally, the generated response is converted to speech using ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech and played back to the user.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs an audio response generated by ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech, which is then played back to the user as the chatbot's reply.
