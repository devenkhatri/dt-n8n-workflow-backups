# Workflow Analysis for LLM Chain AI Agent with Tools

## Description
This workflow demonstrates how to create an AI agent using a Large Language Model (LLM) Chain that can interact with various tools to answer questions and perform tasks.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually and receives a text input from the user.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by clearing previous messages. Then, it initializes an AI agent with access to a SerpApi (Google Search) and a Calculator tool. The agent processes the user's input, deciding which tool to use or if it can answer directly. It formulates a response based on the agent's decision and the output of any tools used. Finally, the workflow creates a new JSON object to store the conversation history.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a conversational response from the AI agent and updates the chat history in a JSON object.
