# Workflow Analysis for RAG Movie Recommender with Qdrant and OpenAI

## Description
This workflow uses a Recommender Augmented Generation (RAG) system to suggest movies based on user queries, leveraging Qdrant for vector search and OpenAI for natural language processing.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and requires a text input (user query) to recommend movies.

## Process Summary
The workflow first takes a user query and creates an embedding using OpenAI. It then searches for similar movie embeddings in Qdrant. The retrieved movie information is combined with the original query to generate a prompt for OpenAI, which then provides a movie recommendation.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a movie recommendation based on the user's query, generated by OpenAI.
