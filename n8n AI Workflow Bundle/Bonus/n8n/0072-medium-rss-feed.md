# Workflow Analysis for Medium User RSS Feed

## Description
This workflow retrieves the RSS feed for a specified Medium user, extracts relevant article information, and makes it available as a webhook response.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP GET request to a webhook, requiring a Medium username as a query parameter.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a Medium username from the webhook. It then constructs the Medium user's RSS feed URL and fetches the RSS feed content. The workflow parses the XML data, extracts the article title, link, and publication date for each item, and filters out any items that do not have a publication date. Finally, it constructs a clean JSON output of the extracted articles.

## Output Details
The workflow returns a JSON array of Medium articles, each containing a title, link, and publication date, as an HTTP response.
