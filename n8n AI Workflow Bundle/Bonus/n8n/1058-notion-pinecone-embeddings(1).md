# Workflow Analysis for Notion to Pinecone Embeddings Workflow

## Description
This workflow extracts data from a Notion database, processes it in chunks, generates embeddings using OpenAI, and stores these embeddings in Pinecone for semantic search capabilities.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by retrieving items from a specified Notion database. It then splits the text content of each item into smaller chunks suitable for embedding generation. Subsequently, for each chunk, it generates a vector embedding using the OpenAI API. Finally, these generated embeddings, along with their corresponding text and Notion IDs, are upserted into a Pinecone index.

## Output Details
The workflow stores vector embeddings in a Pinecone index, enabling semantic search and retrieval.
