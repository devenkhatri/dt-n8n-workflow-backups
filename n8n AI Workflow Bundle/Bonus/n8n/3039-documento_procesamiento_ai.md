# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Document Processing Workflow

## Description
This workflow automates the extraction, processing, and storage of document information using AI capabilities.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and does not receive any input data initially.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by retrieving an image from a specified URL. It then uses an AI model to extract text from the image, performing optical character recognition (OCR). The extracted text is then combined with a prompt to ask follow-up questions to another AI model. The responses from this AI model are then processed to extract specific information such as name, identification, birthdate, and expiration date. Finally, this extracted information is saved as a JSON file.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a JSON file containing extracted document information (e.g., name, ID, birthdate, expiration date) and saves this file.
