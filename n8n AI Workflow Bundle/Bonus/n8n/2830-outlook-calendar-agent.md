# Workflow Analysis for Outlook Calendar Agent

## Description
This workflow acts as an Outlook Calendar Agent, allowing you to interact with your Outlook Calendar using natural language. It can create new events, update existing ones, and retrieve calendar information based on your requests.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually by an HTTP request containing a natural language command.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins by receiving a natural language command via an HTTP request. This command is then sent to an OpenAI Chat BBN model for interpretation and to determine the appropriate action to take (e.g., create event, update event, get events). Based on the model's response, a conditional switch directs the flow to the relevant Outlook Calendar operation node. Each operation node is configured to perform a specific action on the Outlook Calendar, using data extracted or generated by the OpenAI model. Finally, the workflow returns the result of the Outlook Calendar operation or an error message if the command could not be processed.

## Output Details
The workflow returns a JSON response containing the result of the Outlook Calendar operation, such as details of the created/updated event or retrieved calendar items.
