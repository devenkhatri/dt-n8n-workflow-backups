# Workflow Analysis for Jira Ticket Autoresolver with AI

## Description
This workflow automatically resolves Jira tickets by analyzing their content with AI to determine if they are suitable for automated closure, updates the ticket status, and logs the action.

## Input Details

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by extracting information from the incoming Jira ticket data. It then uses an AI model to assess if the ticket can be automatically resolved based on its content. If the AI determines the ticket is resolvable, the workflow updates the ticket status in Jira to "Done". Finally, it logs the outcome of the resolution attempt, including any errors, for auditing purposes.

## Output Details
