# Workflow Analysis for Incident Integration Workflow

## Description
This workflow serves as an incident integration system, designed to receive incident reports and disseminate them to relevant platforms for immediate action and tracking. It acts as a central hub for incident management, ensuring that all necessary teams and systems are notified and updated.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually by an HTTP Request and receives JSON data containing incident details.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by extracting key information from the incoming incident data, such as contact details, severity, status, and related services. It then uses decision logic to route the incident based on the severity levelâ€”categorizing it as critical, high, medium, or low. For critical incidents, it posts a message to a Discord channel, creates an incident in a dedicated incident management system, and sends an SMS notification. For other severities, it also creates an incident in the management system and sends a message to Discord, but without an SMS. Finally, the workflow logs all processed incidents into a Google Sheet for record-keeping and analysis.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs include Discord messages, SMS notifications, and new incidents created in an incident management system, with all processed data logged in a Google Sheet.
