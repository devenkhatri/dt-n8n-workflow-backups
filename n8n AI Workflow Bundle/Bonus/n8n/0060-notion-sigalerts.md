# Workflow Analysis for Notion Sigalerts Workflow

## Description
This workflow automates the process of fetching traffic sigalerts, summarizing them using OpenAI, and then creating or updating a Notion database with this information, including an estimated travel time.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually and does not require any specific input data.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by retrieving traffic sigalerts from a specified API. It then processes each sigalert, using OpenAI to generate a summary. For each sigalert, it also calculates the estimated travel time from a defined starting point to the sigalert location. Finally, it checks if a corresponding entry already exists in a Notion database; if not, it creates a new page, otherwise, it updates the existing page with the latest information, including the summary, travel time, and a status based on a "valid until" date.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs updated or newly created pages in a Notion database, containing summarized sigalert information and estimated travel times.
