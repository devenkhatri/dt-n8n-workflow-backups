# Workflow Analysis for Telegram Chatbot with Multi-format Responses

## Description
This workflow creates a Telegram chatbot that can respond to user messages with various formats, including text, images, videos, and files, based on the user's input.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming message to a Telegram bot.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a message from Telegram. It then checks if the message is a command using an IF node. If it is a command like "/image", "/video", or "/file", it sends the corresponding media or document back to the user. If the message is not a command, it uses an AI model (OpenAI) to generate a text response, which is then sent back to the user via Telegram.

## Output Details
The workflow responds to the Telegram user with either a text message, an image, a video, or a document based on the user's input.
