# Workflow Analysis for Pipedrive Organization Sync

## Description
This workflow synchronizes organization data between two Pipedrive accounts, ensuring that updates in one account are reflected in the other.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered or can be scheduled to run at regular intervals.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins by retrieving all organizations from a specified Pipedrive account. It then iterates through each organization, checking if an organization with the same name already exists in the second Pipedrive account. If a matching organization is found, the workflow updates its details in the second account; otherwise, a new organization is created. Finally, the workflow logs any errors encountered during the synchronization process.

## Output Details
The workflow updates or creates organizations in a Pipedrive account and logs any errors encountered.
