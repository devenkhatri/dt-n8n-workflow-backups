# Workflow Analysis for Automated Ticket Processing for Email Support

## Description
This workflow automates the process of creating and updating support tickets based on incoming emails, classifying their sentiment, and then responding appropriately.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and does not receive any specific input data.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by retrieving new emails from a configured inbox. It then classifies the sentiment of each email as positive, negative, or neutral. If the sentiment is positive or neutral, it creates a new ticket in a support system. If the sentiment is negative, it first searches for an existing ticket related to the sender. If an existing ticket is found, it updates that ticket with the new email content; otherwise, it creates a new ticket for the negative feedback.

## Output Details
The workflow creates or updates tickets in a support system and potentially sends automated responses based on email sentiment.
