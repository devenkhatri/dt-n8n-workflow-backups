# Workflow Analysis for SQL Agent Scheme

## Description
This workflow acts as an AI agent that can interact with a SQL database to answer questions. It uses natural language processing to understand user queries, convert them into SQL queries, execute them, and then present the results in a human-readable format.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered by an HTTP request containing a user query.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a user's question via an HTTP request. It then initializes an agent with access to a SQL database. The agent processes the user's natural language question, translates it into an appropriate SQL query, and executes the query against the database. Finally, the agent interprets the query results and formats them into a human-readable answer, which is then returned as an HTTP response.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a JSON object containing the AI agent's answer to the user's SQL query.
