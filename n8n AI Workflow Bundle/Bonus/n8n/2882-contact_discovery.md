# Workflow Analysis for Automated Contact Discovery with Hunter.io and Messaging

## Description
This workflow automates the process of finding contact information for a given domain and then sending a personalized message using a messaging service. It leverages Hunter.io for email discovery and a generic messaging node for outreach.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered and requires a domain name and a company ID as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by manually receiving a domain and company ID. It then uses Hunter.io to find email addresses associated with that domain. If contacts are found, it iterates through them, constructs a personalized message incorporating the contact's first name and the company ID, and then sends this message via a generic messaging service. If no contacts are found, the workflow ends gracefully.

## Output Details
The workflow sends personalized messages to discovered contacts via a messaging service, or it completes without sending messages if no contacts are found.
