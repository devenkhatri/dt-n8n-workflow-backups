# Workflow Analysis for AI Airtable Agent

## Description
This workflow acts as an AI agent that interacts with an Airtable database. It can summarize tables, answer questions, and perform actions like updating records based on user input.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually and receives a prompt as input.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow identifies the intent of the user's prompt (e.g., summarize, answer, update). If the intent is to summarize, it retrieves all records from the specified Airtable and uses an AI model to generate a summary. If the intent is to answer a question, it retrieves records, prepares context, and uses an AI model to answer the question. If the intent is to update, it identifies the record to update, and then updates the specified fields in Airtable. Finally, it uses an AI model to generate a natural language response based on the action taken.

## Output Details
