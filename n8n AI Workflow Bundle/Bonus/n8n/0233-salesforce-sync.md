# Workflow Analysis for Salesforce Contact and Account Sync

## Description
This workflow synchronizes contact and account information between a database and Salesforce, handling new entries, updates, and creating related records.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and does not receive any specific input data.

## Process Summary
The workflow first retrieves all contacts from a database. For each contact, it checks if an associated account exists in Salesforce. If not, a new account is created in Salesforce with the company name, otherwise it tries to retrieve that account. Then, it checks if the contact already exists in Salesforce. If an existing contact is found, its information is updated; otherwise, a new contact is created in Salesforce associated with the retrieved or newly created account.

## Output Details
The workflow updates and creates records in Salesforce, ensuring that contact and account information from the database is reflected in Salesforce.
