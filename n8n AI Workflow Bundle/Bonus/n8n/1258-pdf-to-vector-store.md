# Workflow Analysis for PDF to Vector Store Workflow

## Description
This workflow automates the process of extracting text from a PDF, splitting it into manageable chunks, creating embeddings from these chunks, and storing them in a Pinecone vector database. This is particularly useful for building AI applications that require searching and retrieving information from documents.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by fetching a PDF file from a specified URL. It then extracts all text content from the PDF. The extracted text is then split into smaller chunks, each of which is subsequently used to generate unique embeddings. Finally, these embeddings are stored in a Pinecone vector database, making the documentâ€™s content searchable through its semantic representation.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs embeddings of the PDF content into a Pinecone vector database.
