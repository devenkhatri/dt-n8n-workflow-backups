# Workflow Analysis for RSS Feed Monitor and Notifier

## Description
This workflow monitors an RSS feed for new items, filters them based on keywords, and sends notifications to a Discord channel if new matching items are found. It also stores the GUIDs of processed items in a Google Sheet to prevent duplicate notifications.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually by clicking the "Execute Workflow" button or via a scheduled interval.

## Process Summary
The workflow first reads items from a specified RSS feed. It then checks each item to see if its Global Unique Identifier (GUID) has already been processed and stored in a Google Sheet. New items are filtered based on a configurable keyword. If new matching items are found, a Discord notification is sent with the item details. Finally, the GUIDs of all newly processed items are appended to the Google Sheet to avoid future reprocessing.

## Output Details
The workflow sends notifications to a Discord channel and updates a Google Sheet with processed RSS item GUIDs.
