# Workflow Analysis for Generate SQL from Schema

## Description
This workflow generates SQL queries to create a database schema based on user-provided table and column details. It can be used by developers and database administrators to quickly set up new database tables.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and receives table and column details as input from the user.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by merging basic table information (table name, column count) and an array of column details. It then generates SQL columns, considering whether they are primary keys, unique, or nullable. Finally, it constructs the complete SQL "CREATE TABLE" statement.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a SQL "CREATE TABLE" statement, which can be directly used to create a database table.
