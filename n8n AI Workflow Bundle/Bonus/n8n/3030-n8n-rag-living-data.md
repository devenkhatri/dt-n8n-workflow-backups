# Workflow Analysis for RAG with Living Data

## Description
This workflow demonstrates a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline that utilizes "living data" from various sources, including Google Cloud products, to generate responses. It excels at answering subjective, up-to-date, and multi-variable questions by retrieving information from diverse data sources, processing it, and then generating a cohesive answer using a language model.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered and receives query as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a user query. It then performs a Google search to find relevant information. This information is then passed to a language model which generates an answer to the query. Finally, the workflow integrates the generated answer with additional functionalities to enhance the response.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a comprehensive answer to the user's query, enhanced by information retrieved from Google Search and processed by a language model.
