# Workflow Analysis for Automate Support Issues Workflow

## Description
This workflow automates the process of handling support requests by categorizing them using AI, creating tickets in a ticketing system, and notifying the support team.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP POST request to a webhook, typically when a new support issue is reported.

## Process Summary
The workflow first receives support issue details via a webhook. It then uses an AI model to categorize the issue as "Bug," "Feature Request," or "Question" and extracts relevant information. Based on the categorization, it creates a new ticket in a ticketing system (e.g., Jira, Asana) and then sends a notification to a designated support team channel (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams). Finally, it sends an email confirmation to the user who submitted the issue.

## Output Details
The workflow creates a new ticket in a project management tool, sends notifications to the support team, and provides an email confirmation to the user.
