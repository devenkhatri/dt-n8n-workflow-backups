# Workflow Analysis for API Schema Extractor

## Description
This workflow extracts the schema from an API endpoint by making a request and then processing the JSON output to identify data types and structures. It can handle both single object and array responses, and also allows for optional authentication.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and takes API details like URL, headers, and authentication to extract the schema.

## Process Summary
The workflow first makes an HTTP request to the provided API endpoint. It then checks if the response is an array or a single object and processes it accordingly. The workflow iterates through the JSON data to identify data types and structures, handling nested objects and arrays. Finally, it constructs a schema representation of the API response, which is then made available.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a structured JSON schema representing the API response, which can then be used for documentation or further processing.
