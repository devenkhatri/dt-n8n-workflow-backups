# Workflow Analysis for Automated Contact Form Processing with Generative AI

## Description
This workflow automates the processing of contact form submissions, leveraging generative AI for smart responses and efficient lead management. It receives contact details and form content, enriches the data, generates tailored responses, and then stores the information and sends out communications.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by new submissions to a contact form, receiving the sender's email, name, and the message content as its input.

## Process Summary
The workflow first validates the incoming contact form data. It then uses generative AI to extract key information from the message and classify its intent. Based on the classification, it drafts a personalized response. Finally, it stores the contact details in a CRM or spreadsheet and sends the AI-generated response via email.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a personalized email response to the sender and updates a customer relationship management (CRM) system or a Google Sheet with the contact and message details.
