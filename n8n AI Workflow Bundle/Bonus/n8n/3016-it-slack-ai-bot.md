# Workflow Analysis for IT Support Slack AI Bot

## Description
This workflow automates IT support by creating a Slack AI bot that answers questions based on a knowledge base and escalates to human support if necessary, improving response times and efficiency.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP POST request, typically from a Slack webhook, containing user queries as messages.

## Process Summary
The workflow first checks if the Slack message contains a URL and extracts the URL if present. It then queries a Coda knowledge base with the user's question and generates an AI-powered answer. If no suitable answer is found in the knowledge base, the workflow escalates the query by mentioning relevant IT support personnel in Slack. Finally, the workflow posts the AI-generated answer or the escalation message back to Slack.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a response to Slack, either an AI-generated answer from the knowledge base or an escalated message to IT support.
