# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Keyword Research and Content Clustering

## Description
This workflow automates keyword research and content clustering using AI, extracting keywords from an initial topic, generating search queries, fetching Google Search results, and organizing them into semantically related clusters for content creation.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered and requires an initial topic and a list of target countries as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by using an AI model to extract relevant keywords from the initial topic. It then generates Google Search queries based on these extracted keywords. Next, it performs Google searches for each query and retrieves the results. The workflow then processes these search results, extracts key information, and transforms it into a structured format. Finally, it uses another AI model to cluster the search results based on semantic similarity, creating groups of related content ideas.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs clustered content ideas, organized by semantic similarity, which can be used to inform content strategy and creation.
