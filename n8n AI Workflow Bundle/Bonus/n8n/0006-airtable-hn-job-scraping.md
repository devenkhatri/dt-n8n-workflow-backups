# Workflow Analysis for Hacker News Job Scraper to Airtable

## Description
This workflow automates the scraping of job postings from Hacker News and stores them in an Airtable base.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow identifies if it's running for the "first time" to decide whether to fetch all job IDs or only new ones. Next, it retrieves a list of the latest job stories from the Hacker News API. Each job story is then processed to extract its content, and finally, a sentiment analysis is performed on the job description. The workflow compares the newly scraped items with existing records in Airtable to avoid duplicates and updates or creates new records as needed.

## Output Details
The workflow updates an Airtable base with new or updated Hacker News job postings, including sentiment analysis results.
