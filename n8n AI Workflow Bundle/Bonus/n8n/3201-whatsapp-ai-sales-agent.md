# Workflow Analysis for WhatsApp AI Sales Agent

## Description
This workflow automates customer interactions on WhatsApp by acting as an AI sales agent, answering frequently asked questions, qualifying leads, and escalating to a human agent when necessary.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered by an incoming WhatsApp message received via a webhook.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by extracting information from the incoming WhatsApp message. It then checks for previous conversations with the user in a database and retrieves them. An AI model (OpenAI assistants) processes the user's message and past conversation history to generate a response. The response is then sent back to the user on WhatsApp. If the AI determines that human intervention is required, the conversation is marked for escalation.

## Output Details
The workflow sends automated AI-generated responses back to the WhatsApp user and can escalate conversations to a human agent.
