## Input Details

## Process Summary
First, the workflow identifies if a specific topic is provided. If not, it uses a default topic to generate a content title via OpenAI. Next, it generates the main content for the post using OpenAI based on the chosen topic and title. Concurrently, it creates a relevant image using DALL-E. Finally, it combines the generated content and image into a new WordPress post, setting the status to "publish", assigning categories, and adding tags.
