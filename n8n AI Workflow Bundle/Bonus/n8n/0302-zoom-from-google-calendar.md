# Workflow Analysis for Automate Zoom Meeting Creation from Google Calendar Events

## Description
This workflow automates the process of creating Zoom meetings for new events in your Google Calendar that have "Zoom" in their title. It ensures that every important scheduled meeting automatically gets an associated Zoom conference.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an authenticated Google Calendar Trigger node, which listens for new or updated events in a specified Google Calendar.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by retrieving new or updated Google Calendar events. It then checks if the event title contains the word "zoom" (case-insensitive). If it does, the workflow creates a new Zoom meeting with details extracted from the Google Calendar event. Finally, it updates the original Google Calendar event with the Zoom meeting link and additional information, ensuring all participants have the correct meeting details.

## Output Details
The workflow updates the Google Calendar event with the newly created Zoom meeting link and other relevant Zoom meeting details.
