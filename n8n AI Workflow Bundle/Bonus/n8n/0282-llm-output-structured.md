# Workflow Analysis for LLM Output Structure

## Description
This workflow demonstrates how to structure Large Language Model (LLM) output by providing a clear schema and generating an example based on a user-defined prompt.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually and receives input from the user for the prompt and desired output schema.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a manual trigger. It then takes a user-defined prompt and a JSON schema as input. The workflow constructs a prompt for the LLM, instructing it to generate an example output that conforms to the provided JSON schema. Finally, it uses the OpenAI Chat Model to generate the structured output.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a structured JSON response generated by the OpenAI Chat Model, conforming to the user-defined schema.
