# Workflow Analysis for AI Calendar Agent with Google Calendar and OpenAI

## Description
This workflow acts as an AI-powered calendar agent, allowing you to manage your Google Calendar using natural language commands. It leverages OpenAI for understanding your requests and Google Calendar for event management.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP request, expecting natural language commands as part of the request.

## Process Summary
The workflow receives a natural language command and sends it to OpenAI for processing. OpenAI then interprets the command and determines the intended action (e.g., create an event, list events). Based on OpenAI's response, the workflow executes the relevant Google Calendar operation. Finally, it formats the result from Google Calendar and sends it back to OpenAI for a human-readable summary.

## Output Details
The workflow responds to the initial HTTP request with a human-readable summary of the executed calendar action, generated by OpenAI.
