# Workflow Analysis for Automated WordPress Post Creation from PDF Content using AI

## Description
This workflow automates the creation of WordPress posts from PDF content. It extracts text from a PDF, uses AI to generate a post title and content, and then publishes the post to WordPress, optionally including a featured image.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP request containing a PDF file in its body.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a PDF file via an HTTP request. It then converts this PDF file into text format. An AI model called "OpenAI" is used to generate a suitable title and rich content for a WordPress post based on the extracted text. This generated content is then formatted and published as a new post on a WordPress site. If the original PDF included an image, it is uploaded to WordPress and set as the featured image for the new post.

## Output Details
The workflow creates a new post on a WordPress site, providing a confirmation of the successful post creation and optionally uploading a featured image.
