# Workflow Analysis for Gmail Multi-Channel Post (MCP) Server

## Description
This workflow acts as a server to receive and process messages, store them temporarily, and then send them via Gmail. It supports handling multiple messages and includes error handling for invalid input.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered by an HTTP POST request, expecting a JSON payload containing email message data.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by validating the incoming HTTP request body to ensure it is a valid JSON array of messages. If the input is invalid, it returns an error. For each valid message, it extracts the recipient, subject, and body, and then sends the email using Gmail. If an email fails to send, it records the error without stopping the entire process. Finally, it constructs a response indicating the success or failure of each email sent.

## Output Details
The workflow returns an HTTP 200 response containing a JSON array with the status (success/failure) for each email processing attempt.
