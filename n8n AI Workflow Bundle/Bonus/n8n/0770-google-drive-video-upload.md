# Workflow Analysis for Google Drive Video Upload and Storage

## Description
This workflow automates the process of handling incoming video files, saving them to Google Drive, and optionally forwarding them to another webhook.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP POST request, expecting a video file and an optional forward URL in the request body.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a video file via an HTTP POST request. It then saves this video file into a specified folder on Google Drive. If a "forward" URL is provided in the initial request, the workflow then sends the received video file to that specified URL via another HTTP POST request. Finally, it constructs a response containing the Google Drive file ID and a message indicating if the video was forwarded.

## Output Details
The workflow responds with a JSON object containing the Google Drive file ID and a message about whether the video was forwarded.
