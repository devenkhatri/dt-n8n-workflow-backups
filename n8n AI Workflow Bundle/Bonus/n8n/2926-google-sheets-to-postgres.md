# Workflow Analysis for Google Sheets to PostgreSQL Data Synchronization

## Description
This workflow automates the process of extracting data from a Google Sheet, transforming it, and then inserting or updating this data into a PostgreSQL database, ensuring that the database always reflects the latest information from the spreadsheet.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually, allowing for on-demand execution to synchronize data.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by reading all data from a specified Google Sheet. It then iterates through each row of the spreadsheet data. For each row, it checks if a corresponding record already exists in the PostgreSQL database based on the "email" column. If a record exists, it updates the existing record in the database with the new data from the Google Sheet; otherwise, it inserts a new record into the database. Finally, it formats the output of the database operations.

## Output Details
The workflow updates or inserts records into a PostgreSQL database and outputs the results of these database operations.
