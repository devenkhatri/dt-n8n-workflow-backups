This workflow serves as a backend for a personal assistant, handling voice input, processing it with OpenAI, and responding with synthesized speech.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP POST request and receives a file with voice input.

## Process Summary
The workflow receives voice input and transcribes it using OpenAI Whisper. The transcribed text is then sent to OpenAI Chat for processing and generating a text response. This response is then converted into speech using OpenAI Text-to-Speech. Finally, the synthesized speech is encoded into base64.

## Output Details
The workflow responds to the initial HTTP request with a base64 encoded audio file containing the personal assistant's spoken response.
