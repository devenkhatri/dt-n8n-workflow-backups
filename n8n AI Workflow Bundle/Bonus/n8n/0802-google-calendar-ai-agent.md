# Workflow Analysis for Google Calendar AI Agent with OpenAI

## Description
This workflow acts as an AI agent to manage your Google Calendar. It allows you to create new events, update existing events, and find events based on natural language commands.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually by an HTTP request containing a prompt.

## Process Summary
The workflow receives a prompt from the user and sends it to the OpenAI API to determine the user's intent. Based on the intent, it either creates a new Google Calendar event, updates an event, or searches for events. If creating or updating, it extracts relevant information like event name, description, and time using OpenAI. Finally, it performs the requested action on Google Calendar and responds to the user.

## Output Details
The workflow constructs a natural language response based on the Google Calendar operation and returns it as an HTTP response.
