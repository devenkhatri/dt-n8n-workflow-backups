# Workflow Analysis for Google Sheets to PostgreSQL Data Synchronization

## Description
This workflow automates the process of extracting data from a Google Sheet, transforming it, and then inserting or updating this data into a PostgreSQL database, ensuring that the database remains synchronized with the latest information from the spreadsheet.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered or can be scheduled to run at regular intervals, initiating the data extraction process from a specified Google Sheet.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by reading all data from a Google Sheet. It then iterates through each row of the spreadsheet, transforming the data by converting relevant fields to appropriate data types and ensuring consistent formatting. Following the transformation, the workflow checks if a record with a matching unique identifier already exists in the PostgreSQL database. If a record exists, it updates the existing record with the new data from Google Sheets; otherwise, it inserts a new record into the database.

## Output Details
The workflow updates or inserts data into a PostgreSQL database, synchronizing the database with the information from the Google Sheet.
