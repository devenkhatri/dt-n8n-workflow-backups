# Workflow Analysis for RAG Context Chunking for AI Workflows

## Description
This workflow efficiently chunks input documents into smaller, manageable pieces, making them suitable for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) processes in AI applications. It leverages a custom Python script to perform intelligent text splitting.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and requires a plain text document as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by taking an input document. It then executes a Python script that employs the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from the `langchain` library to divide the document into chunks of 1000 characters, with an overlap of 200 characters. These chunks are processed to ensure they are valid. Finally, the workflow outputs a JSON array, where each element is a textual chunk of the original document.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a JSON array containing the text chunks derived from the input document.
