# Workflow Analysis for Slack Idea Capture and Google Sheets Logging via OpenAI

## Description
This workflow captures ideas posted in a specific Slack channel, summarizes them using OpenAI, and then logs the summarized ideas into a Google Sheet for organized tracking and management.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by new messages posted in a designated Slack channel, receiving the message content as input.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow identifies if a new message is posted in the configured Slack channel. If a message is detected, it then extracts the text content of the Slack message. Following this, the message content is sent to OpenAI to generate a concise summary. Finally, the original message text, the generated summary, and a timestamp are appended as a new row to a specified Google Sheet.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs the original Slack message, its OpenAI-generated summary, and a timestamp into a new row in a Google Sheet.
