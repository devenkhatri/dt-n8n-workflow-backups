## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving lead data from an HTTP request. It then proceeds to enrich the lead data using Clearbit to gather additional company and social information. Subsequently, it checks if an organization with the enriched company name already exists in HubSpot. If no existing organization is found, it creates a new one in HubSpot; otherwise, it uses the existing organization ID. Finally, the workflow creates or updates a contact in HubSpot with the lead information, associating it with the identified or newly created organization.
