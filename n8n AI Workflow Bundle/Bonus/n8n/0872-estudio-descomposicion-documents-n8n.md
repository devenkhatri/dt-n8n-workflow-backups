# Workflow Analysis for Document Decomposition and Analysis with OpenAI

## Description
This workflow processes documents by splitting them into manageable chunks, generating summaries and semantic information using OpenAI, and then storing or visualizing these insights. This advanced document processing workflow leverages AI to transform raw document content into structured, actionable intelligence.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually and receives document data as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by processing individual documents, splitting PDF files into specified page ranges, or handling various document types by converting them into unified text. It then splits lengthy document text into smaller, manageable chunks suitable for AI processing. Subsequently, it utilizes OpenAI to summarize these text chunks, generating titles and summaries, and extracting semantic information like keywords and concepts. Finally, it combines the processed data, allowing for further visualization or storage of the extracted insights.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs structured data containing document insights, including titles, summaries, and semantic information, which can be further processed or stored.
