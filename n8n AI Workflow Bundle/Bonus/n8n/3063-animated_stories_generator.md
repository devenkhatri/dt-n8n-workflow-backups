# Workflow Analysis for Animated Stories Generator

## Description
This workflow generates animated stories based on user input, leveraging AI to create images, generate voiceovers, and compile them into a video.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and receives input for the story idea, output directory, and optionally, a directory for audio.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow takes a story idea and generates a series of images using DALL-E. Then, it iterates through these images, generating corresponding voiceovers using a text-to-speech API. Next, it combines the images and voiceovers into individual video clips. Finally, all the video clips are merged into a single animated story video, which is then saved to the specified output directory.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs an animated story video file (.mp4) saved to a user-defined output directory.
