# Workflow Analysis for AI Image Search with Object Detection, CDN, and Elasticsearch

## Description
This workflow creates an AI-powered image search engine by detecting objects within images, storing them on a CDN, and indexing the object data in Elasticsearch for efficient searching.

## Input Details
This workflow is primarily triggered by a webhook, receiving image data or a URL to an image.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving image data via a webhook. It then uploads the image to a CDN for storage and accessibility. Next, it uses an AI model to detect objects within the uploaded image. Finally, the detected objects and image URL are indexed into Elasticsearch, making the image searchable based on its content.

## Output Details
The workflow stores processed image data and detected objects in Elasticsearch, enabling a searchable image database.
