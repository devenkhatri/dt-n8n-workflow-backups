# Workflow Analysis for Autonomous AI Web Crawler

## Description
This workflow automates web scraping, content summarization, data storage, and notification for new web content related to specific topics using AI.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually by clicking the "Execute Workflow" button.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by fetching URLs from a specified source (e.g., a Google Sheet like Airtable). It then proceeds to scrape content from each URL and leverages an AI model (like OpenAI) to summarize the extracted text. The summarized data is then stored in a Pinecone vector database for efficient retrieval and analysis. Finally, the workflow sends a notification via email (e.g., SendGrid) to inform stakeholders about the newly processed web content.

## Output Details
The workflow stores summarized web content in a Pinecone database and sends email notifications with the latest updates.
