# Workflow Analysis for Google Sheets Task Management Agent

## Description
This workflow automates task management by interacting with a Google Sheet, allowing users to add, update, and manage tasks through a chat-based interface.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP request, likely from a chat application, containing user input for task management.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow extracts the user's message and identifies the intent (add, update, delete, list tasks) using an AI model. Next, it performs conditional logic based on the identified intent. If a task needs to be added or updated, the workflow interacts with a Google Sheet to perform the corresponding operation. If the user wants to list all tasks, the workflow retrieves tasks from the Google Sheet and formats them. Finally, the workflow constructs a response for the user, which may include task details or confirmation messages, and sends it back to the originating chat application.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a conversational response, often containing task details or confirmations, back to the user via an HTTP response.
