# Workflow Analysis for AI News Data Ingestion

## Description
This workflow automates the ingestion of AI news articles from various RSS feeds, processes them, generates summaries, and stores them in a database for further use in an AI news application.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually or on a scheduled basis.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by fetching URLs from a database that contain RSS feeds for AI news articles. It then iterates through these URLs, retrieves the RSS feed content, and extracts relevant article data such as title, link, and publication date. Each article's content is further processed to extract the full text and generate a concise summary using an AI model. Finally, the processed data, including the summary, is stored back into the database for display in an AI news application.

## Output Details
The workflow stores processed AI news article data, including summaries, into a PostgreSQL database.
