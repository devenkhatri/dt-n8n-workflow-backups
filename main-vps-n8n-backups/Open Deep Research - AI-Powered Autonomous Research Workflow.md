# Workflow Analysis for Open Deep Research - AI-Powered Autonomous Research Workflow

## Description
This workflow triggers an AI-powered autonomous research agent to perform research based on a user-provided prompt and saves the research results.

## Input Details
This workflow is manually triggered and receives a research prompt as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow first extracts the research prompt from the trigger data. Then, it sends this prompt to an AI agent (presumably a custom HTTP endpoint like SuperAGI or an OpenAI GPT model) to initiate the autonomous research process. Finally, it stores the results received from the AI agent in a JSON file.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a JSON file containing the research results.
