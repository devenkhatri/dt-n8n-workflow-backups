# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered PDF Question Answering

## Description
This workflow allows users to upload a PDF document and ask questions about its content. The workflow uses AI to extract text from the PDF, create embeddings, and then answer user questions based on the document.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP request, expecting a PDF file and a user question as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a PDF file and a query. It then extracts text from the PDF and splits it into smaller chunks. These chunks are converted into numerical representations (embeddings) using an AI model. A prompt is then constructed, combining the user's query with the relevant PDF text chunks. Finally, an AI model generates an answer to the question based on the provided context.

## Output Details
The workflow returns the AI-generated answer to the user's question as an HTTP response.
