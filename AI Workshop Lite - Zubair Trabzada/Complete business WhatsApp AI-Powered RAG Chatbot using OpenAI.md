# Workflow Analysis for Business WhatsApp AI RAG Chatbot

## Description
This workflow sets up and operates an AI-powered chatbot for WhatsApp, designed to assist customers of an electronics store. It uses a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system where a knowledge base, sourced from Google Drive documents, is stored in a Qdrant vector database. The chatbot answers customer queries received via WhatsApp by leveraging this knowledge base and an OpenAI-powered AI agent, providing product information, technical support, and general customer service.

## Input Details
The workflow is primarily triggered by incoming WhatsApp messages via a Meta webhook POST request. It also includes a manual trigger for initial setup, which populates a Qdrant vector store with documents from Google Drive.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow initializes or refreshes a Qdrant collection and then downloads documents from a specified Google Drive folder. These documents are converted to plain text, embedded using OpenAI, chunked, and stored in the Qdrant vector database. When a WhatsApp message is received, the workflow checks if it is a valid text message. If it is, the message is fed into an AI agent, which retrieves relevant information from the Qdrant knowledge base using an OpenAI chat model and conversational memory. If the message is not a text message, a predefined response is sent.

## Output Details
The workflow responds to users on WhatsApp with either a generic message if only text is allowed or a detailed answer generated by the AI agent based on the retrieved knowledge.
