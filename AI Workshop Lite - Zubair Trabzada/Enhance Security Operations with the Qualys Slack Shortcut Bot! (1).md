# Workflow Analysis for Qualys Vulnerability Search and Reporting via Slack

## Description
This workflow allows security teams to quickly search for vulnerability information in Qualys and receive a formatted report directly within Slack by using a Slack bot shortcut.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually by a user via a Slack shortcut.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by retrieving user input from a Slack shortcut, which includes the vulnerability ID (QID). It then retrieves the requested vulnerability details from Qualys, formats the Qualys response into a user-friendly message, and finally sends the formatted vulnerability report to the original Slack channel where the shortcut was invoked.

## Output Details
The workflow sends a formatted vulnerability report containing Qualys information back to the Slack channel where the shortcut was initiated.
