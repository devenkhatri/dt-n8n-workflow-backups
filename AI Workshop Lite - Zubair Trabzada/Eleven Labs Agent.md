# Workflow Analysis for AI Assistant for Scheduling and Information Retrieval

## Description
This workflow acts as an AI-powered assistant that can book meetings on a Google Calendar and fetch information from the web based on user requests.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming HTTP POST request to a webhook, receiving user details such as name, phone, email, date, and time in the request body, and a user query in the URL parameters.

## Process Summary
Upon receiving a webhook request, an AI Agent uses an OpenAI chat model to process the user's query and provided personal details. It is configured to act as a helpful assistant that can either search the web using SerpAPI for general information, or check and book appointments on a Google Calendar. If a meeting is requested, it first verifies availability using the Get_Events tool and then uses the Book_Meeting tool to create the event.

## Output Details
The workflow responds to the original webhook request with a JSON object containing the status or output generated by the AI agent.
