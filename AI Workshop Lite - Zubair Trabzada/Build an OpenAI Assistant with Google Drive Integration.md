# Workflow Analysis for OpenAI Assistant with Google Drive Integration

## Description
This workflow demonstrates how to integrate an OpenAI Assistant with Google Drive to process user queries and provide relevant information from documents stored in Google Drive.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered and receives no initial data, relying on subsequent user input for interaction.

## Process Summary
The workflow initializes by creating or retrieving an OpenAI Assistant. It then enters a loop, waiting for user input through a UI. When input is received, it creates a new thread for the Assistant, adds the user message, and runs the Assistant. If the Assistant requires a tool, it uses a custom tool to search Google Drive for relevant documents, uploads these documents to the Assistant, and then resubmits the run. Finally, it retrieves and returns the Assistant's response.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs the OpenAI Assistant's responses, which may include information retrieved from Google Drive documents, displayed in a user interface.
