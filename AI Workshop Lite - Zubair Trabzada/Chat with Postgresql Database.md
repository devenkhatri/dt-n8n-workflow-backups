# Workflow Analysis for Chat with Postgresql Database

## Description
This workflow enables users to interact with a PostgreSQL database through natural language chat. It uses an AI agent powered by OpenAI to understand user queries, inspect the database schema, generate appropriate SQL queries, execute them, and return human-readable responses based on the results.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered when a chat message is received via a webhook, containing a natural language question or request about the PostgreSQL database.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts when a user sends a chat message. An AI agent, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model, interprets the message and decides which database tools to use. It can retrieve the list of database tables and their schemas, get detailed column definitions for specific tables, or execute custom SQL queries generated by the AI. The agent maintains a chat history buffer to provide context-aware responses. Finally, it returns the query results as a natural language response to the user.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a natural language response to the user's chat message, based on data retrieved from the PostgreSQL database, and maintains conversation history for context.
