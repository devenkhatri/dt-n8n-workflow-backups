# Workflow Analysis for Chat with PostgreSQL Database

## Description
This workflow allows users to interact with a PostgreSQL database using natural language through an AI-powered chatbot, enabling them to query and retrieve information from the database without writing SQL.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered when a chat message is received via a Langchain Chat Trigger.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins by receiving a chat message. An AI Agent, configured with an OpenAI Chat Model and utilizing chat history for context, then processes the message. The agent intelligently decides which of three PostgreSQL tools to use: executing custom SQL queries, listing database schemas and tables, or retrieving specific table definitions. After interacting with the database using the chosen tool, the AI agent synthesizes the information and generates a relevant response.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a natural language response generated by the AI agent, based on the PostgreSQL database interactions, back to the user via the chat interface.
