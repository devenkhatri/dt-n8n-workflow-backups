# Workflow Analysis for Chat with PostgreSQL Database

## Description
This workflow allows users to interact with a PostgreSQL database using natural language queries powered by a large language model.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP POST request containing a user query in the request body.

## Process Summary
The workflow receives a user query and constructs a prompt for a large language model, instructing it to generate a SQL query based on the user's input and a provided database schema. It then executes the generated SQL query against a PostgreSQL database. The results from the database are then used to construct another prompt for the large language model, asking it to summarize the SQL query result in natural language. Finally, the natural language summary generated by the AI is returned as the workflow's output.

## Output Details
The workflow returns a natural language summary of the PostgreSQL query results as an HTTP response.
