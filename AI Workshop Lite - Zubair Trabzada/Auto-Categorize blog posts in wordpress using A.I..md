# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered WordPress Post Categorization

## Description
This workflow automates the categorization of new WordPress blog posts using AI to suggest relevant categories based on post content. This ensures consistent and accurate categorization, saving manual effort and improving content organization.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP webhook, typically when a new post is published in WordPress, receiving data about the post including its title and content.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow extracts the post content and title from the incoming webhook data. This information is then sent to an AI model (OpenAI's GPT) with a prompt to suggest WordPress categories that match the post's content. Subsequently, the workflow processes the AI's response, extracting the suggested categories. Finally, it uses the WordPress API to update the original post with the newly suggested categories.

## Output Details
The workflow updates the original WordPress post with the AI-suggested categories, eliminating the need for manual categorization.
