# Workflow Analysis for OpenRouter AI Model Selection Workflow

## Description
This workflow serves as a flexible router for sending user queries to various AI models hosted on OpenRouter, allowing for dynamic model selection based on predefined conditions and providing a unified response format.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP request, expecting a JSON payload containing user input and potentially a specified AI model.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins by receiving an HTTP request with user data. It then checks if a specific AI model is requested; if not, it defaults to a general "nano" model. A switch statement directs the request to the appropriate OpenRouter AI model based on the selected model name. The AI model processes the user input, generates a response, and then a function node extracts and formats the AI-generated content. Finally, an HTTP response node sends the processed content back to the requester.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs an HTTP response containing the AI model's generated text based on the user's input.
