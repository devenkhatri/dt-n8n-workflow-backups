# Workflow Analysis for Tax Code Assistant with Qdrant, Mistral.ai, and OpenAI

## Description
This workflow creates a tax code assistant that uses AI to answer tax-related questions by leveraging Qdrant for vector search, Mistral.ai for conversational AI, and OpenAI for embedding generation.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and receives a query string as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a user query. It then creates an embedding of the query using OpenAI. This embedding is used to search for relevant tax code snippets in Qdrant. The retrieved context, along with the original query, is then sent to Mistral.ai to generate a coherent answer. Finally, the generated answer is returned to the user.

## Output Details
The workflow returns an AI-generated answer to the tax-related query.
