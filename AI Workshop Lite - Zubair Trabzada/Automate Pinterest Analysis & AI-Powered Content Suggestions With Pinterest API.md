It fetches Pinterest pins, extracts relevant information, categorizes them, and then uses AI to suggest new content ideas based on popular pins. This helps businesses to optimize their Pinterest strategy and create engaging content.

## Input Details

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by retrieving the most popular pins from Pinterest for a specific category or topic using the Pinterest API. It then extracts key information from each pin, such as the image, description, and engagement metrics. Next, it uses an IF node to filter the pins based on certain criteria, such as a minimum number of repins or likes. For the pins that meet the criteria, the workflow uses an OpenAI node to generate content suggestions and marketing copy. Finally, it formats the output into a readable format for content creators.

## Output Details
