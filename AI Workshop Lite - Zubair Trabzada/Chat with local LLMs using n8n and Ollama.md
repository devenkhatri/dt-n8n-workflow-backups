# Workflow Analysis for Local LLM Chat with Ollama

## Description
This workflow enables users to interact with local Large Language Models (LLMs) using Ollama, processing chat messages and returning responses.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP request via a webhook, receiving chat messages as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by configuring an HTTP response to return data immediately. It then extracts the chat message from the incoming webhook data. Next, it sends this message to a local LLM via Ollama to generate a response. Finally, it formats the LLM's response and sends it back as the HTTP response.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a JSON object containing the LLM's response, which is returned directly to the initiating HTTP request.
