# Workflow Analysis for WhatsApp Chatbot with OpenAI and Google Sheets

## Description
This workflow automates a WhatsApp chatbot using OpenAI for natural language processing and Google Sheets for data storage and retrieval. It allows users to ask questions, provides answers generated by AI, and captures user contact information.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming WhatsApp message received via a webhook.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by extracting the incoming message and the sender's phone number from the WhatsApp webhook payload. It then checks if the sender's phone number already exists in a Google Sheet. If a name has not been previously provided, the workflow asks the user for their name and updates the Google Sheet. It uses OpenAI to generate a response to the user's message and sends this response back to the user via WhatsApp. This enables a dynamic, AI-powered conversation while maintaining a record of user interactions.

## Output Details
The workflow sends AI-generated messages back to the user on WhatsApp and updates a Google Sheet with user names and chat history.
