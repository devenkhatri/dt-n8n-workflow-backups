# Workflow Analysis for Automated Customer Feedback Analysis and Response with Planet Slice

## Description
This workflow automates the process of collecting customer feedback via a web form, analyzing it for sentiment using an AI model, and then generating tailored responses based on the sentiment and user-defined rules. It supports different response mechanisms such as emails or internal notifications.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by new submissions to a custom web form, which provides customer feedback data.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow receives customer feedback from a web form. Then, it initializes a custom AI model (likely for sentiment analysis) and processes the received feedback. Next, it makes a decision based on the sentiment analysis outcome, routing positive feedback from specific customers and negative feedback from specific customers to different branches. Finally, it sends an email response for positive feedback, another email for negative feedback, and a generic internal Slack notification for all other feedback.

## Output Details
The workflow sends appropriate email responses to customers based on their feedback sentiment and sends internal notifications to Slack.
