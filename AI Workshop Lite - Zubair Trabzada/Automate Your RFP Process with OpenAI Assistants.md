# Workflow Analysis for Automate RFP Response with OpenAI Assistants

## Description
This workflow automates the RFP (Request for Proposal) response generation process using OpenAI Assistants. It allows users to upload RFP documents, which are then analyzed by an AI assistant to generate responses. The AI assistant can also retrieve information from provided knowledge files to enhance the quality of the responses, and the user can interact with the assistant for further refinement.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a webhook, receiving a file ID and a knowledge file ID as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by retrieving the uploaded RFP file from OpenAI storage and defining the system instructions for the AI assistant. It then creates a new thread for the assistant and attaches the uploaded knowledge file if provided. Next, it adds the RFP document as a message to the assistant's thread. Finally, it runs the assistant to generate a response, which can be further refined through user interaction.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a conversational response from the OpenAI Assistant, providing a draft RFP response that can be refined through further interaction.
