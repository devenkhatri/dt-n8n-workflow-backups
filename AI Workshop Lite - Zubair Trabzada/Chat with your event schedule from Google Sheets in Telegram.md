# Workflow Analysis for Telegram Event Schedule Chatbot with Google Sheets Integration

## Description
This workflow allows users to interact with their event schedule stored in Google Sheets directly through a Telegram chatbot. Users can ask questions about events and receive relevant information.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming message from a Telegram bot, specifically when a user sends a message to the bot.

## Process Summary
The workflow receives a message from a Telegram user. It then retrieves all rows from a Google Sheet acting as the event schedule. The user's query and the event data from the Google Sheet are sent to an AI model (OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo) to generate a relevant response. Finally, the AI-generated response is sent back to the user via Telegram.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a conversational response to the Telegram user, providing information about events based on their query and the data from Google Sheets.
