# Workflow Analysis for PDF Content Extraction and AI Summarization

## Description
This workflow automates the extraction of content from a PDF file, processes it using AI models (Claude and/or Gemini) for summarization or data extraction, and then potentially stores or displays the results.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and receives a PDF file from an SFTP server.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by downloading a PDF file from an SFTP server. It then converts this PDF into plain text. This extracted text is then sent to two different AI models, Claude and Gemini, to perform specified AI tasks like summarization or data extraction. Finally, the responses from both AI models are combined and can be further processed or stored.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs structured data or summaries generated by the AI models, which can be sent to an HTTP request for further processing or display, or stored as a file.
