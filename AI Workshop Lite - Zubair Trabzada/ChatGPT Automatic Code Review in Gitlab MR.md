# Workflow Analysis for Automated Code Review with ChatGPT for Gitlab Merge Requests

## Description
This workflow automates the process of code review for Gitlab Merge Requests (MRs) using ChatGPT. When a new MR is opened or updated, the workflow extracts the code changes, sends them to ChatGPT for analysis, and then posts the generated review comments back to the Gitlab MR.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered by an HTTP webhook whenever a Gitlab Merge Request event (e.g., MR opened, updated) occurs, receiving MR details and code changes.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow extracts relevant information from the Gitlab webhook payload, including project ID, MR ID, and source and target branch names. Next, it retrieves the diff of the code changes associated with the MR from Gitlab. It then sends this code diff, along with instructions for a code review, to the ChatGPT API. After receiving the review comments from ChatGPT, the workflow formats these comments. Finally, it posts the formatted ChatGPT review as a comment to the corresponding Gitlab Merge Request.

## Output Details
The workflow posts automated code review comments generated by ChatGPT directly to the Gitlab Merge Request as a system note.
