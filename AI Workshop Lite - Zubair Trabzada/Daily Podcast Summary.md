# Workflow Analysis for Daily Podcast Summary with AI and Notion Integration

## Description
This workflow automates the process of fetching daily podcast transcripts, summarizing them using AI, and storing the summaries in Notion.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually by a user.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by fetching three recent podcast episodes from an RSS feed. It then iterates through each episode, skipping if a summary for that episode already exists in Notion. For each new episode, it retrieves the transcript, uses an AI model to generate a summary, and creates a Notion page with the podcast details and summary. Finally, it updates the Notion page with the full AI-generated summary.

## Output Details
The workflow creates and updates Notion database pages with podcast summaries and details.
