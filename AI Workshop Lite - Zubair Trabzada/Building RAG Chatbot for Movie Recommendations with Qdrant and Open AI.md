# Workflow Analysis for Building RAG Chatbot for Movie Recommendations with Qdrant and Open AI

## Description
This workflow sets up a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot to provide movie recommendations using a Qdrant vector database and OpenAI's language models.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered either manually to upload movie data or by a user's chat message to get movie recommendations.

## Process Summary
Initially, the workflow fetches a CSV file of IMDb movies from GitHub, extracts the movie data, generates embeddings using OpenAI, and stores them in a Qdrant vector database. When a chat message is received, an AI agent uses an OpenAI chat model and a workflow tool to interpret the user's request, extracting positive and negative movie examples. It then queries the Qdrant vector database for recommendations based on these examples, retrieves the full movie metadata, and passes it to the AI agent. The AI agent then formulates a natural language response with the top 3 movie recommendations.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a natural language response with the top 3 movie recommendations, generated by an AI agent, based on the user's input.
