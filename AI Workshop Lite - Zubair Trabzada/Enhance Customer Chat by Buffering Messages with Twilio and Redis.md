# Workflow Analysis for Enhance Customer Chat by Buffering Messages with Twilio and Redis

## Description
This workflow enhances customer chat interactions by buffering messages using a combination of Twilio and Redis, ensuring efficient and reliable communication.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP webhook, receiving incoming chat messages with a "From" number and "Body" text.

## Process Summary
The workflow first checks if the incoming message is a new chat session by looking for "reset" in the message body or checking for an existing Redis key. If it is a new session, it initializes a new chat buffer in Redis. Otherwise, it retrieves the existing chat buffer from Redis, appends the new message, and stores the updated buffer back into Redis, setting an expiration time for the buffer. Finally, it formats the chat history into a string, ready for further processing.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs the formatted chat history as a string, which can then be used by downstream systems for conversational AI or other purposes.
