# Workflow Analysis for AI System Creates Voice-Narrated Videos

## Description
This workflow automates the creation of voice-narrated videos by using AI to generate scripts, voices, and then compiling the video.

## Input Details
This workflow is triggered manually and receives no input data.

## Process Summary
This workflow starts by initializing necessary assets like folder IDs and a title. It then constructs a prompt for an AI model (presumably ChatGPT) to generate a video script using a predefined template. After the script is generated, it converts the text content into audio using another AI service (likely ElevenLabs) and stores it in Google Drive. Finally, it combines the audio with a background video and image to create the final video using Google Drive.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a voice-narrated video saved in Google Drive.
