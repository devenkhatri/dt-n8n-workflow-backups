# Workflow Analysis for Text to Speech (OpenAI)

## Description
This workflow converts a given text into spoken audio using OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API, producing an MP3 audio file.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered and uses hardcoded input text and voice settings defined in the workflow.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a manual trigger, then sets the input text and desired TTS voice (defaulting to 'alloy'). It sends a POST request to OpenAI's TTS API with the provided text, selected voice, and the 'tts-1' model. The request includes authentication using a configured OpenAI API key. The API returns an MP3 audio file as a binary response.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a binary MP3 audio file generated by OpenAI's Text-to-Speech API.
