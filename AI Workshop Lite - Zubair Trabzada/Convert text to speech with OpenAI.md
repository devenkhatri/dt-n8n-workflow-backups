# Workflow Analysis for Text to Speech (OpenAI)

## Description
This workflow converts a given text into speech using OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and does not receive any external data at its inception.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow is initiated manually. Next, it sets a predefined input text and a specific voice to be used for the text-to-speech conversion. Finally, an HTTP POST request is sent to the OpenAI TTS API endpoint, providing the model, input text, and selected voice, along with an OpenAI API key for authentication.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a .mp3 audio file (binary) generated by OpenAI's TTS endpoint, which is returned as the API response.
