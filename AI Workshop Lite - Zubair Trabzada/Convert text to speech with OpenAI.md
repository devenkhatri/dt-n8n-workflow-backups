## Description
This workflow converts provided text into an audio file using OpenAI's text-to-speech capabilities.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and receives text input from the user.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by setting static text "Hello. How are you today?" as the input. Then, it uses the OpenAI node to convert this text into speech. Next, it saves the generated audio file to a specified path on the local file system. Finally, it uses the Split In Batches node, though its function is not explicitly defined within the provided context.

## Output Details
