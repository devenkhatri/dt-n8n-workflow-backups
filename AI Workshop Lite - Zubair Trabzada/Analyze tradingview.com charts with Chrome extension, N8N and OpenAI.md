# Workflow Analysis for TradingView Chart Analysis with OpenAI

## Description
This workflow automates the analysis of TradingView charts using a Chrome extension, n8n, and OpenAI to provide trading insights.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a webhook, receiving image data (likely a screenshot of a TradingView chart) and potentially other relevant information from a Chrome extension.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow receives image data via a webhook. It then uses the OpenAI GPT-4 Vision model to analyze the provided image, identifying patterns and generating trading insights. Finally, the analysis results are sent back as a response to the initial webhook trigger, which can then be displayed by the Chrome extension.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a JSON response containing the AI-generated trading insights and analysis, which is sent back to the triggering Chrome extension.
