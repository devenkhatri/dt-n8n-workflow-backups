# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered FAQ Enrichment

## Description
This workflow automates the process of enriching FAQ sections on website pages using AI. It extracts content from specified URLs, generates related questions and answers using OpenAI, and then compiles this information, optionally translating it, to expand and improve website FAQs.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually by providing website URLs as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by retrieving website content from the provided URLs. It then uses OpenAI to generate questions and answers based on the extracted content. Subsequently, it processes and structures the generated FAQ data. If enabled, the FAQ data is translated into another language using DeepL. Finally, the workflow combines all the generated and translated content, preparing it for output.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs enriched FAQ questions and answers, potentially translated, in a structured format ready to be used on website pages.
