# Workflow Analysis for Image Search with AI Object Detection, CDN, and Elasticsearch

## Description
This workflow creates an image search engine. It uses AI to detect objects in images, stores these images and their metadata on a CDN, and then indexes the object detection results in Elasticsearch for searchable image content.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an HTTP request containing an image and its file name.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving an image via a webhook. It then uploads the image to a CDN and performs object detection on it. Next, it saves the object detection results and image metadata to Elasticsearch. Finally, it constructs a response containing the CDN image URL, the file name, and the object detection data.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a JSON response containing the CDN image URL, file name, and detected objects.
