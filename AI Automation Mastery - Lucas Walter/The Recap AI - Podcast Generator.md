# Workflow Analysis for The Recap AI - Podcast Generator

## Description
This workflow automatically generates a short, engaging podcast episode about upcoming fun and non-controversial events in Austin. It fetches event data from an RSS feed, scrapes the content from the event URLs, and then uses AI to craft a professional podcast script complete with voice direction tags. Finally, it converts the script into an audio file using a text-to-speech service.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and begins by fetching data from a predefined RSS feed URL containing Austin event links.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by fetching an RSS feed of Austin events. It then sends the URLs from the feed to a web scraping service to extract the full content of each event page. The workflow polls the scraping service until the job is complete and then compiles all the scraped content into a single text block. This compiled text is fed to a Google Gemini AI model, which writes a structured podcast script following specific guidelines and including ElevenLabs audio tags. Finally, the script is sent to the ElevenLabs API to be converted into an audio file.

## Output Details
The workflow produces an MP3 audio file of a fully narrated podcast episode about Austin events, generated by the ElevenLabs text-to-speech service.
