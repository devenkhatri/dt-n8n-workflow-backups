# Workflow Analysis for The Recap AI - eCommerce UGC Video Generator

## Description
This workflow automatically generates authentic-looking user-generated content (UGC) style marketing videos for eCommerce products using AI. It starts with a product image and name, then creates detailed influencer personas, writes realistic 12-second video scripts, and generates actual videos using AI models, which are then saved to Google Drive.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a web form where users upload a product image file and enter a product name.

## Process Summary
First, the uploaded product image is analyzed using OpenAI's vision model to generate a detailed profile of the ideal influencer persona for promoting the product. Then, Google Gemini creates three different authentic UGC video scripts based on this persona and product details. For each script, a custom first frame is generated by adapting the original product image to match UGC aesthetics and the 9:16 aspect ratio. The workflow then uses Sora 2 API to generate 12-second videos from each script and custom frame, polling for completion status every 15 seconds. Finally, completed videos are uploaded to a specified Google Drive folder with organized naming.

## Output Details
The workflow produces multiple 12-second UGC-style marketing videos in 720x1280 resolution that are automatically uploaded to a Google Drive folder for easy access and distribution.
