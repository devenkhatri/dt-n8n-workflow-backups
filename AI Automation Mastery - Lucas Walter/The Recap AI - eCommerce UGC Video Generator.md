# Workflow Analysis for The Recap AI - eCommerce UGC Video Generator

## Description
This workflow automatically creates authentic-looking user-generated content (UGC) marketing videos for eCommerce products by analyzing a product image, generating an ideal influencer persona, writing realistic video scripts, and producing short-form videos using AI models.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a form submission that includes a product image file and a product name.

## Process Summary
First, the uploaded product image is analyzed using OpenAI's vision model to generate a detailed persona of the ideal influencer for promoting the product. Then, using this persona and the product image, Gemini 2.5 Pro creates three distinct 12-second UGC video scripts with frame-by-frame direction. For each script, a custom first frame is generated by adapting the original product image to a 9:16 aspect ratio. The workflow then uses Sora 2 to generate a video for each script, polling the API every 15 seconds until completion. Finally, each completed video is uploaded to a designated Google Drive folder.

## Output Details
The workflow produces multiple 12-second UGC-style marketing videos in 720x1280 resolution and uploads them to a specified Google Drive folder with organized naming.
