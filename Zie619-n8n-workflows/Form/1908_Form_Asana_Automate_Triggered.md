# Workflow Analysis for Automate Your Customer Service With WhatsApp Business Cloud & Asana

## Description

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by form submissions containing the user's name, phone number, and problem description.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts when a user submits a contact form with their name, phone number, and issue. It then sends an automated WhatsApp message to the user acknowledging receipt of their request. Simultaneously, it creates a new task in Asana with the submitted details, including the issue description and timestamp, so the support team can follow up. The workflow includes error handling to manage potential failures during execution. Setup notes guide users to configure WhatsApp credentials, Asana workspace ID, and form field mappings.

## Output Details
