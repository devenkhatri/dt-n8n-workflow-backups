# Workflow Analysis for AutoClip – Automatically Generate Video Clips and Upload to YouTube

## Description
This workflow automatically creates short-form vertical videos by combining a random inspirational quote, a background video, and background music, then uploads the final video to YouTube.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and pulls input data from Google Sheets (quotes and statuses) and Google Drive (video and music files).

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by retrieving lists of quotes, video backgrounds, and music files from Google Sheets and Google Drive. It merges this data and randomly selects one quote, one video background, and one music track. The selected files are downloaded and saved locally. A custom overlay with the quote and author is prepared using FFmpeg-compatible drawtext commands. The final vertical video is generated by combining the background video, music, and text overlay. The video is then uploaded to YouTube, and the associated Google Sheets records are updated to reflect the upload status and YouTube link.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a short-form vertical video uploaded to YouTube and updates Google Sheets with the video’s YouTube URL and processing status.
