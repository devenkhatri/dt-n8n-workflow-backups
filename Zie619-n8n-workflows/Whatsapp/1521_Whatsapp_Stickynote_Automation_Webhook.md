# Workflow Analysis for AI Customer-Support Assistant · WhatsApp Ready · Works for Any Business

## Description
This workflow provides an AI-powered customer support assistant that responds to customer inquiries received via WhatsApp by analyzing the company's website in real-time.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by incoming WhatsApp messages containing customer inquiries.

## Process Summary
Upon receiving a WhatsApp message, an AI Agent acts as a real-time website assistant, leveraging tools to crawl and extract information from the company's website to formulate a response. The AI's answer is then cleaned by removing formatting and adjusting URLs. Subsequently, the workflow checks if the message is within a 24-hour window since the last interaction. If within the window, the cleaned AI answer is sent; otherwise, a pre-approved template message is sent to re-engage the customer.

## Output Details
The workflow sends either an AI-generated answer or a pre-approved template message back to the customer via WhatsApp.
