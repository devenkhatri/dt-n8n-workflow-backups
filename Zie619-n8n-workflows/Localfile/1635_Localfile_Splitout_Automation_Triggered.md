# Workflow Analysis for Localfiletrigger Workflow

## Description
This automated workflow ingests bank statements from a local file system, analyzes them against tenant and property details using an AI Agent, and then records any identified discrepancies or required actions into a local Excel spreadsheet.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered when a new CSV file (representing a bank statement) is added to the `/home/node/host_mount/reconciliation_project` directory.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow watches for new CSV bank statement files in a specified local folder. Once a new CSV file is detected, its data is read and extracted. An AI agent then processes this bank statement data to reconcile rental payments, leveraging "Get Tenant Details" and "Get Property Details" tools to query a local Excel spreadsheet for relevant information. The AI agent identifies issues such as missed payments, incorrect amounts, or upcoming tenancy endings. Finally, the structured alerts generated by the AI agent are appended as new rows to the "alerts" sheet within the local Excel spreadsheet.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a report of identified rental payment issues and appends these structured alerts to the "alerts" sheet of a local Excel spreadsheet located at `/home/node/host_mount/reconciliation_project/reconcilation-workbook.xlsx`.
