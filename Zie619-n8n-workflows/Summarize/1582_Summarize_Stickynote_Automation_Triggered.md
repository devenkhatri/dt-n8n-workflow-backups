# Workflow Analysis for OpenAI Assistant with custom n8n tools

## Description
This automated n8n workflow leverages an OpenAI Assistant to interact with users. It is equipped with custom tools to provide information, specifically about fictional countries and their capitals, and the current date and time.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a new manual chat message, which serves as input for the OpenAI Assistant.

## Process Summary
The workflow is initiated by a manual chat message, which is then processed by an OpenAI Assistant. The Assistant can utilize two custom tools: a "country_capitals_tool" to either list known fictional countries or find the capital of a specific country by mapping static data, and a "date_tool" to fetch the current date and time. Conditional logic determines which tool is used based on the user's query. Any errors during execution are handled by a dedicated error handler.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs responses generated by the OpenAI Assistant, which can include a list of fictional countries, a specific capital, or the current timestamp, returned as a chat message response.
