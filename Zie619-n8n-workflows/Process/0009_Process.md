## Description
This workflow processes data and performs automated tasks, including data conversion and merging.

## Input Details

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a manual trigger, then generates two sets of data using function nodes, converts the data into a suitable format, and finally merges the two datasets based on a common key.

## Output Details
The merged data is then passed to an error handler, which stops the workflow and reports any errors that occur during execution.
