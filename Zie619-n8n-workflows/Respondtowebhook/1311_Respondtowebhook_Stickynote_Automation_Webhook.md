# Workflow Analysis for chrome extension backend with AI

## Description
This workflow acts as the backend for a Chrome extension, utilizing AI to analyze images and respond to user requests.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming POST request to a webhook, likely receiving image data from a Chrome extension.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by receiving a POST request via a webhook, which is expected to contain an image. This image is then sent to an OpenAI model (gpt-4o-mini) for analysis. The OpenAI model, acting as a financial analyst, interprets the stock or cryptocurrency chart in the image and generates simple insights for novice traders. Finally, the analysis generated by the AI is returned as a text response to the initial webhook request.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs the AI-generated financial analysis as a text response to the initiating webhook call.
