# Workflow Analysis for CV Screening with OpenAI

## Description
This workflow automates the resume screening process using OpenAI for analysis and Supabase for structured data storage. It provides a matching score, a summary of candidate suitability, and key insights into why the candidate fits (or doesn’t fit) the job.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered and receives a direct link to a CV file and a job description as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow is initiated manually. It sets variables including the CV file URL and the job description. It downloads the CV file from the provided URL. It extracts text content from the downloaded PDF document. It sends the extracted CV text and the job description to OpenAI with a specific prompt to analyze the candidate's suitability for the job. The workflow then parses the JSON response from OpenAI, which contains the matching percentage, a summary, and reasons for suitability and unsuitability.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a structured JSON output containing the candidate's matching percentage, a summary of suitability, and detailed reasons for suitability and unsuitability, as generated by OpenAI.
