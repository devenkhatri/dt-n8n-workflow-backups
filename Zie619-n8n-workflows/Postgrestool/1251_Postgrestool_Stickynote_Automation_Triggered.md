# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Database Assistant

## Description
This workflow integrates OpenAI with a Supabase database, enabling users to interact with their data via an AI agent.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by a manual trigger and receives user input through a chat message.

## Process Summary
The workflow uses an AI agent to understand user requests, generates SQL queries based on the requests, and executes the queries on the Supabase database to retrieve the required data. The workflow also includes error handling and security measures. The AI agent is fine-tuned to run custom SQL queries and provide responses to user requests. The workflow retrieves records from the database, extracts and analyzes JSON data stored in tables, and provides summaries, aggregations, or specific data points based on user queries.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a response to the user's request, which is sent back to the user through a chat message.
