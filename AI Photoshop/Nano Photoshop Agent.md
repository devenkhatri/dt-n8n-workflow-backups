# Workflow Analysis for Nano Photoshop Agent

## Description
This workflow acts as an AI-powered Photoshop agent via Telegram, allowing users to upload, manage, and manipulate images in Google Drive through conversational commands.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by new messages on Telegram, capable of receiving either photos or text commands.

## Process Summary
1. A Telegram message initiates the workflow, and a Switch node determines if it's a photo or text.
2. If a photo is received, it's downloaded from Telegram, uploaded to a designated Google Drive folder, and a confirmation message with the file ID is generated.
3. The core of the workflow is the "Photoshop Agent" (a Langchain Agent), which leverages an AI language model (Claude Sonnet 3.5 or GPT 5 mini) and "Simple Memory" to understand user requests.
4. This agent is equipped with several tools: "Change Name" (for Google Drive files), "Combine Images" (using a sub-workflow), "Search Raw Files" and "Search AI Images" (to find images in Google Drive), and "Edit Image" (using a sub-workflow).
5. The agent processes the user's intent, potentially using these tools to perform actions like renaming uploaded photos, combining images, searching for existing images, or initiating image edits.

## Output Details
The workflow sends a response back to the user's Telegram chat, which is the output generated by the AI Photoshop Agent after processing the request.
