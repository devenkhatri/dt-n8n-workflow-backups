# Workflow Analysis for AI Agent Generator Sonnet 4

## Description
This workflow generates AI agents based on a provided prompt, iterating through different temperature settings to produce a variety of responses. It then saves the generated agents to a Google Sheet.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and receives a prompt for AI agent generation as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by taking an input prompt. It then iterates through a predefined list of "temperature" values. For each temperature, it calls an AI model (likely Claude via a custom API) to generate an AI agent based on the prompt. Finally, it formats the output and appends the generated agent along with its temperature, prompt, and a timestamp into a Google Sheet.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs the generated AI agent details (prompt, temperature, agent response, and timestamp) to a specified Google Sheet.
