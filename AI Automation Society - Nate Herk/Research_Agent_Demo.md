# Workflow Analysis for AI Research Agent Demo

## Description
This workflow automates the process of researching a given topic using an AI model and extracting key information.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and receives a query as input.

## Process Summary
First, the workflow takes a user-provided query. Next, it uses a custom Python script to call an AI model (likely a research agent) to generate a research response based on the query. Then, it extracts specific bits of information from the AI model's response, such as the solution, advantages, disadvantages, and a conclusion. Finally, it formats this extracted information for presentation.
