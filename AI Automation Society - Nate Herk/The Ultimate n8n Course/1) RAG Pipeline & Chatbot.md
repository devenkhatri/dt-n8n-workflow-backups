# Workflow Analysis for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline and Chatbot

## Description
This workflow implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to power a custom AI chatbot. It allows external applications to send user queries, retrieves relevant information from a connected knowledge base, and uses a Large Language Model to generate an informed and contextual response.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an external system via a generic webhook, which receives the user's chat query or message as input data.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts upon receiving a user query via a webhook. It then utilizes a Vector Store node to perform a similarity search based on the query, retrieving relevant context documents from a connected knowledge base. Next, a prompt is constructed that combines the original user query with the retrieved context documents. This comprehensive prompt is then sent to an LLM node (such as OpenAI) for generating a final, informed answer. Finally, the generated response is sent back to the calling system via the Webhook Response node.

## Output Details
The final, contextually generated answer from the AI model is immediately returned to the system that initiated the webhook call using a Webhook Response node.
