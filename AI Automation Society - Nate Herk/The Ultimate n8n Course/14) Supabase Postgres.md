# Workflow Analysis for Supabase Postgres Database Interaction Workflow

## Description
This workflow is designed to manage data within a Supabase Postgres database. It typically involves running queries to insert new records or update existing entries based on pre-defined data for testing database connectivity and operations.

## Input Details
The workflow is designed for testing and is initiated by a manual execution.

## Process Summary
The workflow is manually initiated via a Start node. It prepares a payload using a Set node, defining sample data to be processed. Next, a PostgreSQL node connects to the Supabase instance and executes a data manipulation query, such as inserting new data into a specified table. The resulting database response, usually a confirmation of the operation, is then passed to the output.

## Output Details
The workflow returns the raw JSON output confirming the success or failure of the database transaction (e.g., inserted rows or query results).
