# Workflow Analysis for Webhook-Triggered Data Evaluator and Optimizer with Custom Logic

## Description
This workflow is designed to receive an external data payload via a webhook, apply complex custom logic for data evaluation and scoring, and subsequently apply another layer of custom processing to optimize or filter the data before returning the refined result to the originating system.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered instantly by an external POST request to a dedicated webhook endpoint, receiving a payload of JSON data for evaluation.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins upon receiving data via the Webhook Trigger. It immediately passes the incoming data to a "Data Evaluator" node, which executes custom JavaScript code to analyze, process, and score the input items. Next, the scored data moves to the "Data Optimizer" node, which applies a second set of custom JavaScript logic, typically for filtering or transforming items based on their evaluation scores. Finally, the resultant optimized data is formatted and returned to the webhook caller.

## Output Details
The optimized and processed data, after undergoing custom evaluation and transformation, is returned as a JSON response to the caller of the initial webhook.
