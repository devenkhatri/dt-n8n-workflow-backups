# Workflow Analysis for Orchestrator Workflow for Dynamic Task Routing

## Description
This workflow acts as a central command center, receiving an incoming request via a webhook, analyzing the required operation type (e.g., 'CREATE' or 'UPDATE'), and dynamically routing the entire payload to the appropriate specialized worker workflow for execution. This separation of logic is the core of the orchestrator architecture pattern.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an external HTTP request (webhook) and receives a JSON payload that includes an operation_type and the data payload.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a webhook listening for external data and a subsequent node prepares the incoming data, extracting the necessary command. A logic gate (Switch node) then inspects the command (operation_type) to determine the next step. Based on the value, the workflow executes a specific, separate worker workflow using the Execute Workflow node. This architecture ensures specialized worker workflows handle the heavy lifting while the orchestrator handles routing.

## Output Details
The orchestrator workflow returns an immediate HTTP response to the original caller, confirming that the orchestration and routing process has been successfully initiated.
