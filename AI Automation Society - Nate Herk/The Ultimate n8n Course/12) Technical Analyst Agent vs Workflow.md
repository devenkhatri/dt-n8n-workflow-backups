# Workflow Analysis for Technical Analyst: Comparing AI Agent vs. Traditional Workflow

## Description
This workflow demonstrates and compares two methods for performing a technical analysis task: utilizing a sophisticated, autonomous AI Agent versus a structured, multi-step n8n Workflow consisting of API calls and LLM processing. It serves as an educational example to showcase the capabilities and trade-offs of agent-based versus explicit process design in n8n.

## Input Details
The workflow is manually triggered for easy execution and testing, and it requires an initial prompt or query defining the technical analysis task.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by defining the input query and then splits into two parallel branches. The first branch uses a dedicated AI Agent to autonomously analyze the query using its defined tools and reasoning. The second branch follows a traditional approach, using nodes like HTTP Requests for data retrieval and a Chat LLM node for explicit analysis and response generation. Finally, the results from both the AI Agent path and the structured workflow path are merged for comparison.

## Output Details
The workflow produces two distinct outputs—one generated by the AI Agent and one by the structured workflow—allowing the user to compare the efficiency and quality of both methods.
