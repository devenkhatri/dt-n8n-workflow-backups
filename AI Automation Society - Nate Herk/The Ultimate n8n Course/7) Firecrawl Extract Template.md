# Workflow Analysis for Firecrawl Structured Web Content Extractor Template

## Description
A workflow designed to efficiently scrape a target webpage using the Firecrawl service and extract structured data based on a predefined JSON template. This ensures that raw web content is transformed into standardized, queryable data, making it ideal for populating databases or feeding structured input into AI models.

## Input Details
The workflow is initiated by a manual trigger and relies on preceding nodes to provide the target URL and the structured JSON template for data extraction.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins with a manual trigger to initiate the process. A subsequent node (likely a Set or Function node) defines the input, including the target URL and the specific JSON extraction template. The core operation is performed by the Firecrawl node, which uses the 'Extract' mode to scrape the content and apply the template, transforming the raw HTML into structured data. The final output is the clean, structured JSON result.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a structured JSON object containing the specific data fields extracted from the webpage, as defined by the extraction template.
