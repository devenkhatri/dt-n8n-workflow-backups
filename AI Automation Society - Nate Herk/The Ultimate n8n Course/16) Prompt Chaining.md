# Workflow Analysis for AI Content Generation via Prompt Chaining

## Description
This workflow demonstrates a prompt chaining technique using multiple AI models. It first sends an initial request to an AI model to generate a structured plan or outline. It then uses the output of the first model to construct a more detailed prompt for a second AI model, which finally generates the comprehensive, high-quality content or response.

## Input Details
The workflow is typically triggered manually (Manual Trigger node) or by a Webhook, receiving an initial query or topic for content generation.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with an input query defining the content topic. The first AI Chat node, acting as a "Planner," processes this query to create an outline or plan. A subsequent node then takes this plan and the original request to dynamically construct a second, highly specific prompt. The second AI Chat node, acting as the "Writer," uses this sophisticated prompt to generate the final, long-form content.

## Output Details
The final output is the comprehensive, multi-step generated content or article from the second AI model.
