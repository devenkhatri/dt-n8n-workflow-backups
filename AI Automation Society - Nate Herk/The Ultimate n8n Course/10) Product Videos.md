# Workflow Analysis for AI-Powered Product Video Generator

## Description
This workflow automates the creation of short promotional videos for new products. It is triggered by new product data from an external source, uses an AI to generate a compelling script, sends the script to a video rendering service, and finally publishes the completed video to a cloud storage or video hosting platform.

## Input Details
The workflow is typically triggered by an event indicating new product data, such as a new row in a spreadsheet or a webhook from an e-commerce platform.

## Process Summary
The workflow is initiated by a new product data event. First, it extracts key product details, which are then passed to an LLM service (like OpenAI) to draft a marketing video script. Next, the generated script is sent to a third-party video creation API to render the final video file. Finally, the workflow handles the finished video, usually by uploading it to a service like Google Drive or YouTube for distribution.

## Output Details
The final output is a completed product marketing video file uploaded to a designated video hosting or cloud storage platform.
