# Workflow Analysis for Simple AI Agent: Prompt, Reasoning, and Tool Use

## Description
This workflow showcases a fundamental n8n AI Agent setup, designed to take a simple prompt, use external tools like web search for up-to-date information, and provide a reasoned, final answer.

## Input Details
The workflow is intended for manual execution and uses a pre-configured or manually set text prompt as its initial input data.

## Process Summary
The workflow begins with a manual trigger and sets a specific text prompt. This prompt is fed into the AI Agent node, which utilizes a large language model and available tools (such as Google Search) to formulate a detailed response. The Agent's internal logic determines if tool use is necessary before generating the final output. The complete, reasoned response from the AI is then captured as the result.

## Output Details
The final output is the generated text response, produced by the AI Agent after completing its task and tool execution.
