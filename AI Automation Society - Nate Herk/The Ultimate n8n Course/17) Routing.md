# Workflow Analysis for Webhook Data Router and Response

## Description
This workflow receives an incoming HTTP POST request (webhook) and uses a router to direct the data flow to one of three different processing paths based on a specific data field. After the data is processed in the chosen path, the results from all potential paths are merged, and a final customized response is sent back to the system that initiated the webhook.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered by an incoming public HTTP POST request (webhook) and receives data in the request body or query parameters.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a webhook trigger that receives input data. A Set node then prepares or defines a data field (like 'type') used for routing. A Router node evaluates this 'type' field and directs the execution to one of three distinct branches if the 'type' matches "A", "B", or "C". Each branch sets a unique identifier ('route') to track the path taken. Finally, the results from all possible paths are collected by a Merge node and then used to formulate a custom HTTP response sent back to the original caller.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a custom HTTP response containing the processed data (specifically, which route was taken) which is sent back to the system that made the initial webhook call.
