# Workflow Analysis for Apify Actor Execution and Data Retrieval Workflow

## Description
This workflow is designed to interact with the Apify platform to execute an actor (like a web scraper), monitor its progress, and retrieve the resulting structured data. *Note: The provided input was only file metadata, and a detailed analysis is based on the file name "Apify.json" and common n8n workflow structures.*

## Input Details
The workflow is likely triggered manually or on a scheduled basis to start the Apify actor execution.

## Process Summary
The process begins by running a specific Apify actor with defined inputs using the Apify node. A subsequent step monitors the execution status, waiting until the actor completes its task successfully. Once complete, the workflow fetches the structured data output from the actor's run storage, making it available for further processing in subsequent nodes.

## Output Details
The workflow produces a structured dataset (a list of JSON objects) containing the extracted data from the Apify actor's run.
