# Workflow Analysis for RAG Pipeline for Document Analysis

## Description
This workflow processes documents, extracts text, embeds it, and then uses a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to answer questions based on the document content. It leverages AI models for text extraction, chunking, embedding, and answering.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually and requires a document URL and a user question as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts by downloading a document from a provided URL. It then extracts text from the document, splits it into manageable chunks, and generates embeddings for each chunk. These embeddings are stored in a Pinecone vector database. Finally, it retrieves relevant document chunks based on a user question, and uses an AI model to generate an answer informed by these retrieved chunks.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a generated answer to the user's question, based on the analyzed document content.
