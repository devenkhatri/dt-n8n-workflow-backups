# Workflow Analysis for Calendar Agent Demo

## Description
This workflow acts as an AI-powered calendar assistant that can manage Google Calendar events. It uses an AI agent to understand user requests and perform actions like creating new events (with or without attendees) or retrieving existing events.

## Input Details
The workflow is triggered manually or via an API call and receives a user query as input.

## Process Summary
The workflow starts with a trigger and then passes the incoming query to an AI agent. The AI agent, powered by an OpenAI chat model, interprets the query and decides which Google Calendar tool to use: either "Create Event" for events without attendees, "Create Event with Attendee" for events including attendees, or "Get Events" to retrieve calendar entries. The AI extracts necessary details like event title, start/end times, and attendees from the query to execute the chosen calendar action. Finally, the AI agent's response is set as the workflow's output.

## Output Details
The workflow outputs a response generated by the AI agent, confirming event creation or providing a summary of requested calendar events.
